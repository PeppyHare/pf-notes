Rigorously, a plasma is an ionized gas that is globally neutral and that displays collective effects . 1.1.1 Debye Length Consider a plasma that is initially electrically neutral. That is, the number of negative charges n_e is equal to the number of positive charges n_i . We insert a test charge q_t within the plasma. What will be the electrostatic potential around this test charge? We must solve the Poisson equation to determine the potential \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\left[ q_t \\delta (\\vec \\gr) + e n_i ( \\vec{\\gr}) - e n_e ( \\vec \\gr )\\right] To a first approximation, we treat the ions as a fixed background, since they are very heavy compared to the electrons and do not move. n_i (\\vec \\gr) = n_0 The equation of motion that governs the motion of the electrons is m_e \\dv{ \\vec{u}_e}{t} = - e \\vec{E} - \\frac{1}{n_e} \\grad P_e = - e \\vec{E} - \\frac{1}{n_e} \\grad( n_e k_b T_e) where the pressure P_e can be written in terms of the temperature and the Boltzmann constant. In order to simplify the notation of plasma physics, we tend to express the temperature in terms of the Boltzmann constant k_B T_e \\rightarrow T_e The temperature is then actually measured in terms of energy (electron volts typically). Now we can make some hypotheses. First, the electrons are very light, so the respond immediately to changes in the plasma. That is, m_e \\rightarrow 0 Second, we will assume that the electric field is given by \\vec{E} = - \\grad \\phi Finally, we assume that the electrons are isothermal, so T_e \\approx \\text{const.} Putting these together, the equation of motion is 0 \\approx e \\grad \\phi - T_e \\frac{\\grad n_e}{n_e} \\\\ \\rightarrow 0 \\approx \\grad \\left( e \\phi - T_e \\ln n_e \\right) \\\\ \\rightarrow e \\phi - T_e \\ln n_e \\approx \\text{const.} \\\\ \\rightarrow n_e = n_0 e^{\\left( \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\right)} So, when there is no electric field, the electron density will be equal to the initial density, as expected. Now, what happens when we insert this density into the Poisson equation we were initially looking at? \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 } \\left[ q_t \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) + e n_0 - e n_0 e^{\\left( \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\right)} \\right] If the perturbations are small, e \\phi / T_e \\ll 1 then the taylor expansion of the exponential gives \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{q_t}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta ( \\vec \\gr )+ \\frac{e^2 n_0}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} \\phi = - \\frac{q_t \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) }{\\epsilon_0} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2 _{De}} \\phi where \\lambda_{De} is the electron Debye length defined as \\lambda_{De} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\epsilon_0 T_e}{e^2 n_0}} Now we've reduced the problem of determining the potential to \\grad ^2 \\phi - \\frac{1}{ \\lambda ^2 _{De}} \\phi = - \\frac{q_t}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) We can solve this by working in spherical coordinates or look up the solution in our favorite undergrad E&M text \\phi ( \\gr) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon} \\frac{q_t}{\\gr} e^{- \\gr / \\lambda _{De}} What does this potential look like if we plot it against distance from our test charge? The potential is a combination of the standard Coulomb potential and an exponential factor whose argument is always negative. The effect of the plasma is actually to \"screen\" the potential that a charged particle would have in vacuum. In order to describe the plasma, we have used concepts like density, disregarding the fact that the charged particles themselves are discrete. So we used a statistical approach that is valid only if there are a large number of particles within a space characterized by a Debye cube \\lambda_{De} ^3 \\rightarrow n \\lambda_{De} ^3 = N_D \\gg 1 For quick calculations iff we express our temperature in Kelvin and n_0 in cm^{-3} an estimation of the Debye length is \\lambda _{De} \\approx 6.9 \\sqrt{T_e / n_0} \\, \\text{cm} Or, if temperature is in electron volts and n_0 in m^{-3} then \\lambda_{De} \\approx 7 \\cdot 10^{3} \\sqrt{T_e/n_0} \\, \\text{m} Conclusions: First, if we want to have deviation from quasi-neutrality, n_e = n_0 e^{\\frac{e \\phi}{T_e}} \\neq 0 , then \\gr \\leq \\lambda_{De} (This requires to have N_D \\gg 1 . A second conclusion we can draw which is much more important: we assumed that \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\ll 1 . Does this actually make much sense? \\phi goes to infinity for \\gr = 0 . In fact, there is a minimum distance at which looking at our equation makes sense. What we have to do is evaluate the electrostatic potential at the minimal distance that makes sense to look at, where the Debye screening will not have intervened yet. This will given by the typical distance between particles in a plasma: \\gr _{min} = (1/n_0) ^{1/3} Therefore \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{T_3} n_0 ^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2 n_0}{T_e} \\frac{1}{n_{2/3}} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{ \\lambda_{De} ^2} \\frac{1}{n_0 ^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi N_D ^{2/3}} \\ll 1 From this, we notice that the one-to-one interaction between particles is weak if e \\phi / T_e \\ll 1 , that is for N_D \\gg 1 . In other words, if N_D is large then the electrostatic potential that acts between two charged particles will be much smaller than the electron temperature, so therefore the one-to-one interaction between particles will be weak. 1.1.2 Plasma Frequency Let's consider a plasma that's a slab of electrons with number density n_0 and a fixed background of the same density. We then displace the electrons with respect to the ions by \\delta x . The Coulomb force will tend to pull the electrons back towards the ions. What is the frequency of the resulting oscillation? We first evaluate the electric field \\pdv{E}{x} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} We can break the plasma volume into three regions. At the left end (region 1) there are now more ions than electrons, so \\rho > 0 . At the right end (region 3) there are more electrons, so \\rho < 0 . In the middle, the displacement cancels and \\rho = 0 . In region 2 E = \\frac{n_0 e \\delta x}{\\epsilon_0} The equation of motion of the electrons is m_e \\frac{d ^2 \\delta x}{dt ^2} = -e E = - \\frac{n_0 e^2 }{\\epsilon_0} \\delta x \\\\ \\rightarrow \\frac{d ^2 \\delta x}{dt ^2} + \\left( \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e} \\right ) \\delta x = 0 This equation describes an oscillator with frequency \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}} Observation: we can re-write the electron plasma frequency \\omega_{pe} as \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} \\frac{T_e}{m_e}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} } \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{m_e}} = \\frac{v_{th,e}}{\\lambda_{De}} So there is this relationship between the frequency of the plasma oscillations and the thermal velocity and Debye length. So about how much is the plasma frequency? f_{pe} = 8980 \\sqrt{n_0} where n_0 is expressed as cm^{1/3} 1.1.3 Collision Frequency First, let's try to remind ourselves how collision processes can be described. Say we have a certain number of target particles n_{target} and an electron which moves towards the particles at velocity v_{in} . The electron sees the target particles each coming towards it with an collision area (cross-section) \\sigma . The frequency of collisions will be \\nu_{coll} = n_{target} \\sigma v_{in} What kinds of collisions with our target particles will our electron experience? It could collide with neutral targets, \\nu_{coll} = n_n v_{th, e} \\pi \\rho_0 ^2 , where \\pi \\rho_0 ^2 is the area of the Bohr radius. We can also have Coulomb collisions with other electrons, in which the direction of the electron is deviated by another charged particle. This interaction becomes important when the Coulomb interaction energy is comparable to the kinetic energy. We can estimate the Coulomb interaction energy in terms of the impact parameter b (the distance of closest approach). In that case, the Coulomb interaction energy will become important when \\frac{\\text{Coulomb interaction energy}}{\\text{Kinetic energy}} = \\frac{e^2 / r \\pi \\epsilon_0 b}{m_e v_{th, e}^2} \\approx 1 \\\\ \\rightarrow b \\approx \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 m_e v_{th, e}^2} = b_{\\pi/2} The frequency of electron-electron collisions will then be \\nu _{coll} = n_e v_{th, e} \\pi b_{\\pi/2} ^2 = \\frac{ \\pi n_0 v_{th, e} e^4}{16 \\pi ^2 \\epsilon_0 ^2 m_e ^2 v_{th, e} ^4} = \\frac{n_0 e^4}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 ^2 m_e ^2 v_{th, e} ^3} For the remainder of this section, we'll ignore the neutral collisions, and just look at the electron collisions (which are the most interesting in a plasma). Now we can put all three of these definitions together to define a regime in which plasmas (as defined at the very beginning of this section) can be found. To refresh your memory, a plasma is \"an ionized gas which is globally neutral and displays collective effects.\" To start with, globally neutral means that the size of the plasma must be much larger than the Debye length. The plasma is quasi-neutral at a scale length \\geq \\lambda_{De} \\text{globally neutral} \\rightarrow \\text{size of plasma} \\gg \\lambda_{D_e} To have collective effects, we want the one-to-one interactions between particles to be weak compared to effects throughout the plasma. As we saw this happens with the number of particles in a Debye cube is much more than N_D \\gg 1 \\\\ \\rightarrow \\frac{\\omega_{pe}}{v_{coll}} \\gg 1 \\\\ \\rightarrow \\sqrt{ \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}} \\frac{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 m_e v_{th, e} ^3}{n_0 e^4} \\\\ = 16 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e^3 \\epsilon_0 ^3 n_0 ^2}{e^6 n_0 ^3}} \\\\ = 16 \\pi \\lambda_{De} ^3 n_0 = 16 \\pi N_D \\gg 1 So we have a plasma if we have an ionized gas for which N_D \\gg 1 . We can also introduce a \"plasma parameter\" g g = \\frac{1}{N_D} \\ll 1 Where can we find the plasmas we know about? The following chart describes roughly the regions where real plasmas exist. One useful thing to note is that in the range of parameters considered in these real plasmas, we can ignore both relativistic effects and quantum effects.

Plasmas are made of electrons and ions that move under the effect of EM fields. Those fields are generated self-consistently by the plasma constituents, so if you want to describe a plasma in a self-consistent way, you need to both describe the generation of these EM fields and resultant the motion of the charged particles. To begin with, start with the simplest cases. Assume that the EM fields are given and watch how a charged particle moves under the given fields. 1.2.1 Motion of a particle in static and uniform magnetic field In a magnetostatic situation, you must solve m \\dv{\\vec v}{t} = q ( \\vec v \\cross \\vec B) with \\vec B constant. The variation of the kinetic energy is given by \\dv{}{t} \\left( \\frac{ m v^2}{2} \\right) = m \\vec v \\cdot \\dv{\\vec v}{t} = m \\vec v \\cdot \\frac{q (\\vec v \\cross \\vec B)}{m} = 0 So v^2 is constant. Of course, we already knew that magnetic fields can do no work, so that's not surprising at all.It is convenient to to decompose the velocity of the particle along directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field \\vec v = \\vec v _{\\parallel} + \\vec v_{\\perp} \\vec v_{\\parallel} = ( \\vec v \\cdot \\vec B) \\frac{ \\vec B}{B^2} \\qquad \\vec v_{\\perp} = \\vec v - \\vec v_{\\parallel} Projecting the equation of motion onto the parallel direction gives m \\dv{\\vec v}{t} \\frac{ \\vec B}{B} = m \\dv{v_{\\parallel}}{t} = q ( \\vec v \\cross \\vec B) \\cdot \\frac{\\vec B}{B} = 0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad v_{\\parallel} = \\text{const.} v^2 = v_{\\perp} ^2 + v_{\\parallel} ^2 \\rightarrow v_{\\perp} = \\text{const.} So the derivative of v_{\\perp} is perpendicular to v_{\\perp} and its modulus is constant, so in the perpendicular direction the particle undergoes uniform circular motion with frequency given by the cyclotron frequency \\omega_c = \\frac{v_\\perp}{m v_{\\perp} / |q| B} = \\frac{|q| B}{m} The motion of the particle will be a helical trajectory along the direction of the magnetic field: The handedness of the motion is defined by the charge of the particle. Positively charged particles will move in a left-handed rotation with respect to \\vec B , and negatively charged particles will move with right-handed rotation with respect to \\vec B . 1.2.2 Plasma magnetic properties Just looking at the simple magnetostatic case of a charged particle we can infer some of the magnetic properties of a plasma. In the presence of a magnetic field a charged particle undergoes uniform circular motion, so it produces a current loop. There is a magnetic moment \\vec \\mu associated with a magnetic loop. Some properties of the vector magnetic moment are Its magnitude is | \\vec \\mu | = I \\cdot A = \\frac{|q| \\omega _c}{2 \\pi} \\cdot \\pi \\rho ^2 = \\frac{m v_{\\perp} ^2}{2 B} = \\frac{E_{kin, \\perp}}{B} Its direction will be opposite to \\vec B for both q > 0 and q < 0 . The magnetic field imposed externally will be reduced by the motion of the charged particles in a plasma. In other words, plasmas have diamagnetic properties. \\mu is an adiabatic invariant. What do we mean by this? From analytical mechanics, the action J = \\oint p \\dd q of a coordinate q and its conjugate momentum p is constant under a slow change in an external parameter. This assumes that the motion is periodic if there is no change in an external parameter. Here \\oint is the integral over one period. This means that the magnetic moment will be constant if the externally applied magnetic field changes more slowly than the period of the particle's cyclotron motion. For the magnetic moment \\mu , q = x (in the direction perpendicular to the externally applied B) and p = m v_x . J = \\oint m v_x \\, \\dd x = \\oint m v_x \\dv{x}{t} = \\oint m v_x ^2 \\dd t = \\int_0 ^{2 \\pi / \\omega_c} m v_{\\perp} ^2 \\sin ^2 ( \\omega _c t + \\phi) \\dd t = \\frac{\\pi m v_{\\perp} ^2}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{2 \\pi m}{|q|} \\left( \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2 b} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\pi m}{|q|} \\mu 1.2.3 Motion of a particle in static and uniform E and B First thing's first. Let's write down Newton's equation for a charged particle q under the influence of static electric and magnetic fields m \\dv{\\vec v}{t} = q ( \\vec E + \\vec v \\cross \\vec B) Breaking it apart into directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, Parallel direction: m \\dv{\\vec v _{\\parallel}}{t} = q E_{\\parallel} This is just the equation for uniformly accelerated motion, so the parallel direction is very simple. Perpendicular direction: m \\dv{\\vec v _{\\perp}}{t} = q ( \\vec E_{\\perp} + v_{\\perp} \\cross \\vec B) To get a feel for what happens in the perpendicular direction, let's assume a simple case in which \\vec E points upwards, and \\vec B points out of the page (they are \\perp to each other). We also assume that the particle starts at rest. Initially, it will be accelerated in the direction of the electric field. As it gains velocity, the magnetic field will curve the trajectory clockwise. When the particle turns around and opposes the electric field, it will slow down, and the Larmor radius will decrease accordingly. A \"guiding center\" of the particle's motion will move in a direction perpendicular to both the electric field and the magnetic field. Interestingly, the direction of motion of the guiding center is the same for both positively and negatively charged particles. Let's try to understand what the drift of the guiding center looks like. Averaging the perpendicular equation of motion over one gyroperiod: \\langle m \\dv{v_\\perp}{t} \\rangle = q \\langle \\vec E_\\perp + \\vec v_{\\perp} \\cross \\vec B \\rangle = 0 \\rightarrow \\langle v_{\\perp} \\cross \\vec B = - \\vec E_{\\perp} Taking the cross-product with the magnetic field, \\langle \\vec v_{\\perp} \\rangle \\cross \\vec B \\cross \\vec B = - \\langle v_{\\perp} \\rangle B^2 = - \\vec E_\\perp \\cross \\vec B \\rightarrow \\langle v_{\\perp} \\rangle = \\frac{\\vec E_{\\perp} \\cross \\vec B}{B^2} While we're in the business of decomposing our directions, we can write \\vec v_{\\perp} as a composition of this drift velocity and some \"perturbation\" velocity \\vec v_{\\perp} ' \\vec v_{\\perp} = \\vec v_{E} + \\vec v_{\\perp} ' \\rightarrow m \\dv{\\vec v_{\\perp}'}{t} = q E_{\\perp} + q \\vec v_{E} \\cross \\vec B + q v_{\\perp} ' \\cross B = q E_{\\perp} + q \\frac{ E_{\\perp} \\cross B}{B^2} \\cross B + q v_{\\perp}' \\cross B = q v_{\\perp} ' \\cross B So the motion of a charged particle in the presence of static E and B fields is given by the superposition of gyromotion, uniform E acceleration, and drift motion of the guiding center v_{E} = \\frac{E_{\\perp} \\cross B}{B^2} . The drift direction is independent of the sign of charge. The guiding center will move along isocontour lines of the electrostatic potential: 1.2.4 Motion of a particle in uniform B with arbitrary external force We can easily generalize our drift velocity result to the case of an arbitrary external force \\vec F on top of the Lorentz force. m \\dv {\\vec v}{t} = \\vec F + q \\vec v \\cross \\vec B \\rightarrow \\vec v _{F} = \\frac{ \\vec F_{\\perp} \\cross \\vec B}{q B^2} \\quad \\text{(drift)} Application: Gravitational Force By applying what we know about the drift velocity, what can we say about the behavior of a plasma under the influence of gravity and a magnetic field? Will it fall? Initially, the drift velocity will be perpendicular to both \\vec B and m \\vec g , so it will be horizontal and the plasma will not fall. However, the direction of the drift velocity will be opposite for positive and negatively charged particles. This will lead to a charge buildup, which causes an electric field \\vec E across the plasma. The drift velocity resulting from \\vec E and \\vec B is now pointing downwards, and is in the same direction for both positively and negatively charged particles. Therefore, the plasma will fall downwards under the influence of gravity, but under a much more complicated process than it would initially seem. Application: Curvature Drift What if we have a curved \\vec B ? A particle moving in a curved magnetic field tries to follow the field lines, since motion \\perp to \\vec B is resisted. The particle will experience a centrifugal force F_{c} = \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{R_B ^2} \\vec R_B And as a result, it will drift: \\vec v_{d} = \\frac{\\vec F_C \\cross \\vec B}{q B^2} = \\frac{m v_{\\parallel ^2}}{q B^2 R_B ^2} ( \\vec R_B \\cross \\vec B) \\quad \\text{curvature drift} It turns out that this curvature drift is a very important quantity in plasma physics. 1.2.5 Gradient Drift (non-uniform B) Now, what if our particle moves in a region of non-uniform \\vec B ? Once again, the motion of the particle will follow a guiding center, with a periodic perturbation motion atop. The calculation of the velocity of the guiding center is quite complicated, but the result is \\vec v_{\\grad \\vec B} = \\frac{m v^2}{2 qB^3} ( \\vec B \\cross \\grad \\vec B) This is what is called the \"grad-B drift\" . 1.2.6 Plasma Confinement for Single-Particle Motion How should we go about confining a plasma? We've seen that in the presence of magnetic fields, the trajectory of a charged particle is helical along the field lines. So a magnetic field provides confinement of charged fields perpendicular to the field lines, but not along the parallel direction. If we want to confine a plasma, we need to somehow limit the loss of charged particles along the direction of the magnetic field. Open field lines One way to do this is using open field lines, and noting a force which acts on magnetic moment: \\vec F = - ( \\vec \\mu \\cdot \\grad ) \\vec B As an example, if we have two coaxial ring currents the field lines will constrict through the rings and expand in the region between the rings. This means that a magnetic dipole which is nearer to one of the rings will feel a force toward the other ring, with a stable point in the center. This is the principle behind so-called \"magnetic mirrors\" . Since we've got an axially symmetric system we describe it in cylindrical coordinates r (distance from the axis), \\theta , and z . We will focus on particles which have guiding centers on the axis to simplify the math; a similar result can be obtained for particles moving off-axis. Let's write down the magnetic force near the axis: F_z = q ( \\vec v \\cross \\vec B) = |q| v_{\\perp} B_z since \\div \\vec B = \\frac{1}{r} \\pdv{}{r} (r B_r) + \\pdv{B_z}{z} = 0 \\rightarrow B_z = - \\frac{r}{2} \\pdv{B_z}{z} = - \\frac{r}{2} | \\grad B | \\rightarrow F_z = - |q| v_{\\perp} \\frac{r}{2} | \\grad B | = - |q| v_{\\perp} \\frac{\\rho}{2} | \\grad B| (where \\rho is the Larmor radius) = - \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2 B} | \\grad B| = - \\mu | \\grad B| Where we recognize the magnetic moment we just described in the previous section. So we have recovered the stable force on a magnetic moment in a non-uniform magnetic field. What are the particles that can be confined by a magnetic mirror? As we saw in the previous lecture, the magnetic moment \\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{B} is a constant of motion. It will therefore be equal both at the center of the magnetic mirror and at the edge: \\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m v_{\\perp, c}^2}{B_{min}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m v_{\\perp, e}^2}{B_{max}} where we take the edge (e) and the center (c) of the mirror. The kinetic energy is also a constant of motion E = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_{\\perp, c}^2 + v_{\\parallel, c}^2) = \\frac{1}{2} m ( v_{\\perp, e}^2 + v_{\\parallel, e}^2) A particle will be reflected if, while moving towards B_{max} , v_{\\parallel} vanishes. Therefore E_{kin} = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\perp}^2 \\rightarrow \\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m v_{\\perp, c}^2}{B_{min}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m v_{\\perp, e}^2}{B_{max}} > \\frac{m ( v_{\\perp, e}^2 + v_{\\parallel, e}^2)}{2 B_{max}} = \\frac{E_{kin}}{B_{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m(v_{\\perp, c}^2 + v_{\\parallel, c} ^2)}{B_{max}} \\rightarrow \\frac{v_{\\perp, c}^2}{v_{\\perp, c} + v_{\\parallel, c}^2} > \\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}} We can visualize the region of stability by looking at the phase space (v_{\\perp, c}, v_{\\parallel, c} ) . Outside of the loss cones, the particle will be confined while moving along the axis of the magnetic mirror. An example of a real magnetic mirror is the Earth's magnetic field. Since it is a dipolar field, there are charged particles that move subject to the presence of the magnetic fields. The particles will stream along the field lines. When they approach the magnetic poles, they experience a stronger field and are pushed back, leading to an accumulation of particles in the equatorial regions of the Earth's magnetic field. Closed magnetic field lines We can close the field lines in a toroidal-shaped device, such as a doughnut-shaped solenoid. The field lines within the device are tangential to the ring and closed. This is the design used in tokamaks and stellarators . Imagine a toroidal device with a set of coils carrying a current, creating closed field lines. The intensity of the magnetic field is given by B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N}{2 \\pi} \\frac{I}{r} with N the number of coils, I the current, and r the radius of curvature of the field lines. Since \\vec B is curved, drifts are present!

Put simply, it's the use of computers to obtain a numerical solution to the governing equations of fluid dynamics. As always, the numerical solution is an approximation to the real solution to the equations, but additionally those equations are themselves only an approximation of the real physics.

But often, even in PIC simulations, we approximate many particles ( \\geq 20^{20} ) by fewer superparticles (\\approx 10^6) . Modeling with fewer particles leads to statistical errors, since noise is reduced with larger numbers of particles. When modeling long time scales, those statistical errors build up.

To handle longer time scales and large numbers of particles, we can group the particles into elements in phase space (\\vec v, \\vec x,t ) .
