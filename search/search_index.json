Rigorously, a plasma is an ionized gas that is globally neutral and that displays collective effects . 1.1.1 Debye Length Consider a plasma that is initially electrically neutral. That is, the number of negative charges n_e is equal to the number of positive charges n_i . We insert a test charge q_t within the plasma. What will be the electrostatic potential around this test charge? We must solve the Poisson equation to determine the potential \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\left[ q_t \\delta (\\vec \\gr) + e n_i ( \\vec{\\gr}) - e n_e ( \\vec \\gr )\\right] To a first approximation, we treat the ions as a fixed background, since they are very heavy compared to the electrons and do not move. n_i (\\vec \\gr) = n_0 The equation of motion that governs the motion of the electrons is m_e \\dv{ \\vec{u}_e}{t} = - e \\vec{E} - \\frac{1}{n_e} \\grad P_e = - e \\vec{E} - \\frac{1}{n_e} \\grad( n_e k_b T_e) where the pressure P_e can be written in terms of the temperature and the Boltzmann constant. In order to simplify the notation of plasma physics, we tend to express the temperature in terms of the Boltzmann constant k_B T_e \\rightarrow T_e The temperature is then actually measured in terms of energy (electron volts typically). Now we can make some hypotheses. First, the electrons are very light, so the respond immediately to changes in the plasma. That is, m_e \\rightarrow 0 Second, we will assume that the electric field is given by \\vec{E} = - \\grad \\phi Finally, we assume that the electrons are isothermal, so T_e \\approx \\text{const.} Putting these together, the equation of motion is 0 \\approx e \\grad \\phi - T_e \\frac{\\grad n_e}{n_e} \\\\ \\rightarrow 0 \\approx \\grad \\left( e \\phi - T_e \\ln n_e \\right) \\\\ \\rightarrow e \\phi - T_e \\ln n_e \\approx \\text{const.} \\\\ \\rightarrow n_e = n_0 e^{\\left( \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\right)} So, when there is no electric field, the electron density will be equal to the initial density, as expected. Now, what happens when we insert this density into the Poisson equation we were initially looking at? \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 } \\left[ q_t \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) + e n_0 - e n_0 e^{\\left( \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\right)} \\right] If the perturbations are small, e \\phi / T_e \\ll 1 then the taylor expansion of the exponential gives \\grad ^2 \\phi = - \\frac{q_t}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta ( \\vec \\gr )+ \\frac{e^2 n_0}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} \\phi = - \\frac{q_t \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) }{\\epsilon_0} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2 _{De}} \\phi where \\lambda_{De} is the electron Debye length defined as \\lambda_{De} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\epsilon_0 T_e}{e^2 n_0}} Now we've reduced the problem of determining the potential to \\grad ^2 \\phi - \\frac{1}{ \\lambda ^2 _{De}} \\phi = - \\frac{q_t}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta ( \\vec \\gr ) We can solve this by working in spherical coordinates or look up the solution in our favorite undergrad E&M text \\phi ( \\gr) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon} \\frac{q_t}{\\gr} e^{- \\gr / \\lambda _{De}} What does this potential look like if we plot it against distance from our test charge? The potential is a combination of the standard Coulomb potential and an exponential factor whose argument is always negative. The effect of the plasma is actually to \"screen\" the potential that a charged particle would have in vacuum. In order to describe the plasma, we have used concepts like density, disregarding the fact that the charged particles themselves are discrete. So we used a statistical approach that is valid only if there are a large number of particles within a space characterized by a Debye cube \\lambda_{De} ^3 \\rightarrow n \\lambda_{De} ^3 = N_D \\gg 1 For quick calculations iff we express our temperature in Kelvin and n_0 in cm^{-3} an estimation of the Debye length is \\lambda _{De} \\approx 6.9 \\sqrt{T_e / n_0} \\, \\text{cm} Or, if temperature is in electron volts and n_0 in m^{-3} then \\lambda_{De} \\approx 7 \\cdot 10^{3} \\sqrt{T_e/n_0} \\, \\text{m} Conclusions: First, if we want to have deviation from quasi-neutrality, n_e = n_0 e^{\\frac{e \\phi}{T_e}} \\neq 0 , then \\gr \\leq \\lambda_{De} (This requires to have N_D \\gg 1 . A second conclusion we can draw which is much more important: we assumed that \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\ll 1 . Does this actually make much sense? \\phi goes to infinity for \\gr = 0 . In fact, there is a minimum distance at which looking at our equation makes sense. What we have to do is evaluate the electrostatic potential at the minimal distance that makes sense to look at, where the Debye screening will not have intervened yet. This will given by the typical distance between particles in a plasma: \\gr _{min} = (1/n_0) ^{1/3} Therefore \\frac{e \\phi}{T_e} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{T_3} n_0 ^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2 n_0}{T_e} \\frac{1}{n_{2/3}} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{1}{ \\lambda_{De} ^2} \\frac{1}{n_0 ^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi N_D ^{2/3}} \\ll 1 From this, we notice that the one-to-one interaction between particles is weak if e \\phi / T_e \\ll 1 , that is for N_D \\gg 1 . In other words, if N_D is large then the electrostatic potential that acts between two charged particles will be much smaller than the electron temperature, so therefore the one-to-one interaction between particles will be weak. 1.1.2 Plasma Frequency Let's consider a plasma that's a slab of electrons with number density n_0 and a fixed background of the same density. We then displace the electrons with respect to the ions by \\delta x . The Coulomb force will tend to pull the electrons back towards the ions. What is the frequency of the resulting oscillation? We first evaluate the electric field \\pdv{E}{x} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} We can break the plasma volume into three regions. At the left end (region 1) there are now more ions than electrons, so \\rho > 0 . At the right end (region 3) there are more electrons, so \\rho < 0 . In the middle, the displacement cancels and \\rho = 0 . In region 2 E = \\frac{n_0 e \\delta x}{\\epsilon_0} The equation of motion of the electrons is m_e \\frac{d ^2 \\delta x}{dt ^2} = -e E = - \\frac{n_0 e^2 }{\\epsilon_0} \\delta x \\\\ \\rightarrow \\frac{d ^2 \\delta x}{dt ^2} + \\left( \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e} \\right ) \\delta x = 0 This equation describes an oscillator with frequency \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}} Observation: we can re-write the electron plasma frequency \\omega_{pe} as \\omega_{pe} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} \\frac{T_e}{m_e}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 T_e} } \\sqrt{\\frac{T_e}{m_e}} = \\frac{v_{th,e}}{\\lambda_{De}} So there is this relationship between the frequency of the plasma oscillations and the thermal velocity and Debye length. So about how much is the plasma frequency? f_{pe} = 8980 \\sqrt{n_0} where n_0 is expressed as cm^{1/3} 1.1.3 Collision Frequency First, let's try to remind ourselves how collision processes can be described. Say we have a certain number of target particles n_{target} and an electron which moves towards the particles at velocity v_{in} . The electron sees the target particles each coming towards it with an collision area (cross-section) \\sigma . The frequency of collisions will be \\nu_{coll} = n_{target} \\sigma v_{in} What kinds of collisions with our target particles will our electron experience? It could collide with neutral targets, \\nu_{coll} = n_n v_{th, e} \\pi \\rho_0 ^2 , where \\pi \\rho_0 ^2 is the area of the Bohr radius. We can also have Coulomb collisions with other electrons, in which the direction of the electron is deviated by another charged particle. This interaction becomes important when the Coulomb interaction energy is comparable to the kinetic energy. We can estimate the Coulomb interaction energy in terms of the impact parameter b (the distance of closest approach). In that case, the Coulomb interaction energy will become important when \\frac{\\text{Coulomb interaction energy}}{\\text{Kinetic energy}} = \\frac{e^2 / r \\pi \\epsilon_0 b}{m_e v_{th, e}^2} \\approx 1 \\\\ \\rightarrow b \\approx \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 m_e v_{th, e}^2} = b_{\\pi/2} The frequency of electron-electron collisions will then be \\nu _{coll} = n_e v_{th, e} \\pi b_{\\pi/2} ^2 = \\frac{ \\pi n_0 v_{th, e} e^4}{16 \\pi ^2 \\epsilon_0 ^2 m_e ^2 v_{th, e} ^4} = \\frac{n_0 e^4}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 ^2 m_e ^2 v_{th, e} ^3} For the remainder of this section, we'll ignore the neutral collisions, and just look at the electron collisions (which are the most interesting in a plasma). Now we can put all three of these definitions together to define a regime in which plasmas (as defined at the very beginning of this section) can be found. To refresh your memory, a plasma is \"an ionized gas which is globally neutral and displays collective effects.\" To start with, globally neutral means that the size of the plasma must be much larger than the Debye length. The plasma is quasi-neutral at a scale length \\geq \\lambda_{De} \\text{globally neutral} \\rightarrow \\text{size of plasma} \\gg \\lambda_{D_e} To have collective effects, we want the one-to-one interactions between particles to be weak compared to effects throughout the plasma.

Question : what does the derivative \\dv{f}{x} do for us? Answer : It tells us how rapidly the function f(x) varies when we change the argument x by a tiny amount, \\dd{x} \\dd{f} = \\left( \\dv{f}{x} \\right) \\dd{x} \\tagl{1.33} In words: If we increment x by an infinitesimal amount \\dd{x} , then f changes by an amount \\dd{f} ; the derivative is the proportionality factor. Foe example, in Fig. 1.17(a), the function varies slowly with x , and the derivative is correspondingly small. In Fig 1.17(b), f increases rapidly with x , and the derivative is large as you move away from x = 0 . Geometrical interpretation : The derivative \\dv{f}{x} is the slope of the graph of f versus x . 1.2.2: Gradient Suppose, now, that we have a function of three variables-say, the temperature T (x, y, z) in this room. (Start out in one comer, and set up a system of axes; then for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that spot.) We want to generalize the notion of \"derivative\" to functions like T, which depend not on one but on three variables. A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will prob- ably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. In fact, the question \"How fast does T vary?\" has an infinite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore. Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial derivatives states that \\dd{T} = \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\right)\\dd{x} + \\left( \\pdv{T}{y} \\right) \\dd{y} + \\left( \\pdv{T}{z} \\right) \\dd{z} \\tagl{1.34} This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the infinitesimal amounts dx, dy, dz. Notice that we do not require an infinite number of derivatives - three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three coordinate directions. \\eqref{1.34} is reminiscent of a dot product: \\dd{T} = \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\right)\\cdot ( \\dd{x} \\vu{x} + \\dd{y} \\vu{y} + \\dd{z} \\vu{z} \\\\ = (\\grad{T}) \\cdot (\\dd{\\vec{l}}) \\tagl{1.35} where \\grad{T} \\equiv \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\tagl{1.36} is the gradient of T. Note that \\grad{T} is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. \\eqref{1.35} is the three-dimensional version of \\eqref{1.33} . Geometrical interpretation of the Gradient : Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction . To determine its geometrical meaning, let's rewrite the dot product using Eq. 1.1 \\dd{T} = \\grad{T} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = |\\grad{T}| |\\dd{\\vec{l}}| \\cos \\theta \\tagl{1.37} where \\theta is the angle between \\grad{T} and \\dd{\\vec{l}} . Now if we fix the magnitude |\\dd{\\vec{l}}| and search around in various directions, the maximum change in T evidently occurs when \\theta = 0 (for then \\cos \\theta = 1 ). That is, for a fixed distance, dT is greatest when I move in the same direction as \\grad{T} . Thus: The gradient \\grad{T} points in the direction of maximum increase of the function T. Moreover: The magnitude | \\grad{T} | gives the slope (rate of increase) along this maximal direction Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and find the direction of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here the function we're talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions-latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles (\\theta = 90^{\\circ}) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines). You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have \"kinks\" in them, and correspond to non-differentiable functions. What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If \\grad{T} = 0 at (x, y, z), then \\dd{T} = 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y, z). This is, then, a stationary point of the function T(x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit), a minimum (a valley), a saddle point (a pass), or a \"shoulder.\" This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero. Example 1.3 Find the gradient of r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} (the magnitude of the position vector) Solution \\begin{align*} \\grad{r} & = \\pdv{r}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{r}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{r}{z} \\vu{z} \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{y} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2z}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{z} \\\\ & = \\frac{x \\vu{x} + y \\vu{y} + z \\vu{z}}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{r} = \\vu{r} \\end{align*} Does this makes sense? Well, it says that the distance from the origin increases most rapidly in the radial direction, and that its rate of increase in that direction is 1... just what you'd expect. 1.2.3: The Del Operator The gradient has the formal appearance of a vector, \\nabla , \"multiplying\" a scalar T: \\grad{T} = \\left( \\vu{x} \\pdv{}{x} + \\vu{y} \\pdv{}{y} + \\vu{z} \\pdv{}{z} \\right) T \\tagl{1.38} (For once, I write the unit vectors to the left, just so no one will think that this means \\pdv{\\vu{x}}{x} and so on, which would be zero since the coordinate directions are constant.) The term in parentheses is called del : \\grad{} = \\vu{x} \\pdv{}{x} + \\vu{y} \\pdv{}{y} + \\vu{z} \\pdv{}{z} \\tagl{1.39} Of course, del is not a vector, in the usual sense. Indeed, it doesn't mean much until we provide it with a function to act upon. Furthermore, it does not \"multiply\" T; rather, it is an instruction to differentiate what follows. To be precise, then, we say that \\grad{} is a vector operator that acts upon T, not a vector that multiplies T. With this qualification, though, \\grad{} mimics the behavior of an ordinary vector in virtually every way; almost anything that can be done with other vectors can also be done with \\grad{} , if we merely translate \"multiply\" by \"act upon.\" So by all means take the vector appearance of \\grad{} seriously: it is a marvelous piece of notational simplification, as you will appreciate if you ever consult Maxwell's original work on electromagnetism, written without the benefit of \\grad{} . Now, an ordinary vector \\vec{A} can multiply in three ways: By a scalar a : \\vec{A}a By a vector \\vec{B} , via the dot product: \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} By a vector \\vec{B} , via the cross product: \\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B} Correspondingly, there are three ways the operator \\grad{} can act: On a scalar function T: \\grad{T} (the gradient) On a vector function \\vec{v} , via the dot product: \\div{\\vec{v}} (the divergence ) On a vector function \\vec{v} , via the cross product: \\curl{\\vec{v}} (the curl ) We have already discussed the gradient. In the following sections we examine the other two vector derivatives: divergence and curl. 1.2.4: The Divergence From the definition of \\grad{} we construct the divergence: \\begin{align*} \\div{\\vec{v}} & = \\left( \\vu{x} \\pdv{}{x} + \\vu{y} \\pdv{}{y} + \\vu{z} \\pdv{}{z} \\right) \\cdot (v_x \\vu{x} + v_y \\vu{y} + v_z \\vu{z}) \\\\ & = \\pdv{v_x}{x} + \\pdv{v_y}{y} + \\pdv{v_z}{z} \\tagl{1.40} \\end{align*} Observe that the divergence of a vector function is itself a scalar. Geometrical interpretation : The name divergence is well chosen, for \\div{\\vec{v}} is a measure of how much the vector \\vec{v} spreads out (diverges) from the point in question. For example, the vector function in Fig. 1.18a has a large (positive) divergence (if the arrows pointed in, it would be a negative divergence), the function in Fig. 1.18b has zero divergence, and the function in Fig. 1.18c again has a positive divergence. (Please understand that \\vec{v} here is a function - there's a different vector associated with every point in space. In the diagrams, of course, I can only draw the arrows at a few representative locations.) Imagine standing at the edge of a pond. Sprinkle some sawdust or pine needles on the surface. If the material spreads out, then you dropped it at a point of positive divergence; if it collects together, you dropped it at a point of negative divergence. (The vector function \\vec{v} in this model is the velocity of the water at the surface - this is a two-dimensional example, but it helps give one a \"feel\" for what the divergence means. A point of positive divergence is a source, or \"faucet\"; a point of negative divergence is a sink, or \"drain.\") Example 1.4 Suppose the functions in Fig 1.18 are \\vec{v_a} = \\vec{r} = x \\vu{x} + y \\vu{y} + z \\vu{z} , \\vec{v_b} = \\vu{z} , and \\vec{v_c} = z\\vu{z} . Calculate their divergences. Solution \\div{\\vec{v_a}} = \\pdv{}{x} (x) + \\pdv{}{y} (x) + \\pdv{}{z} (z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 As anticipated, this function has a positive divergence. \\div{\\vec{v_b}} = \\pdv{}{x} (0) + \\pdv{}{0} (x) + \\pdv{}{z} (1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 as expected. \\div{\\vec{v_b}} = \\pdv{}{x} (0) + \\pdv{}{0} (x) + \\pdv{}{z} (z) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 1.2.5: The Curl From the definition of \\grad{} we construct the curl: \\begin{align*} \\curl{\\vec{v}} & = \\begin{vmatrix} \\vu{x} & \\vu{y} & \\vu{z} \\\\ \\pdv{}{x} & \\pdv{}{y} & \\pdv{}{z} \\\\ v_x & v_y & v_z \\end{vmatrix} \\\\ & + \\vu{x} \\left( \\pdv{v_z}{y} - \\pdv{v_y}{z} \\right) + \\vu{y} \\left( \\pdv{v_x}{z} - \\pdv{v_z}{x} \\right) + \\vu{z} \\left( \\pdv{v_y}{x} - \\pdv{v_x}{y} \\right) \\tagl{1.41} \\end{align*} Notice that the curl of a vector function is, like any cross product, a vector. Geometrical Interpretation : The name curl is also well chosen, for \\curl{\\vec{v}} is a measure of how much the vector \\vec{v} swirls around the point in question. Thus the three functions in Fig. 1.18 all have zero curl (as you can easily check for yourself), whereas the functions in Fig. 1.19 have a substantial curl, pointing in the z direction, as the natural right-hand rule would suggest. Imagine (again) you are standing at the edge of a pond. Float a small paddlewheel (a cork with toothpicks pointing out radially would do); if it starts to rotate, then you placed it at a point of nonzero curl. A whirlpool would be a region of large curl. Example 1.5 Suppose the function sketched in Fig 1.19a is \\vec{v_a} = -y \\vu{x} + x \\vu{y} , and that in Fig 1.19b is \\vec{v_b} = x \\vu{y} . Calculate their curls. Solution \\curl{\\vec{v_a}} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\vu{x} & \\vu{y} & \\vu{z} \\\\ \\pdv{}{x} & \\pdv{}{y} & \\pdv{}{z} \\\\ -y & x & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = 2 \\vu{z} and \\curl{\\vec{v_b}} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\vu{x} & \\vu{y} & \\vu{z} \\\\ \\pdv{}{x} & \\pdv{}{y} & \\pdv{}{z} \\\\ 0 & x & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = \\vu{z} As expected, these curls point in the +z direction. (Incidentally, they both have zero divergence, as you might guess from the pictures: nothing is \"spreading out\"... it just \"swirls around.\") 1.2.6: Product Rules The calculation of ordinary derivatives is facilitated by a number of rules, such as the sum rule \\dv{}{x} (f + g) = \\dv{f}{x} + \\dv{g}{x} the rule for multiplying a constant: \\dv{}{x} (kf) = k \\dv{f}{x} the product rule: \\dv{}{x}(fg) = f \\dv{g}{x} + g \\dv{f}{x} and the quotient rule \\dv{}{x} \\left( \\frac{f}{g} \\right) = \\frac{g \\dv{f}{x} - f \\dv{g}{x}}{g^2} Similar relations hold for the vector derivatives. Thus, \\grad{(f + g)} = \\grad{f} + \\grad{g}, \\qquad \\div{(\\vec{A} + \\vec{B})} = (\\div{\\vec{A}}) + (\\div{\\vec{B}}) \\curl{(\\vec{A} + \\vec{B})} = (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) and \\grad{(kf)} = k \\grad f, \\quad \\div{(k\\vec{A})} = k (\\div{\\vec{A}}), \\quad \\curl{(k\\vec{A})} = k(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions: fg \\quad \\text{(product of two scalar functions),} \\\\ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\quad \\text{(dot product of two vector functions),} and two ways to make a vector: f \\vec{A} \\quad \\text{(scalar times vector),} \\\\ \\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B} \\quad \\text{(cross product of two vectors).} Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients: \\grad{(fg)} = f \\grad{g} + g \\grad{f} \\tag{i} \\grad( \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = \\vec{A} \\cross (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) + \\vec{B} \\cross (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\grad{})\\vec{B} + (\\vec{B} \\cdot \\grad{}) \\vec{A} \\tag{ii} two for divergences: \\div{(f\\vec{A})} = f(\\div{\\vec{A}}) + \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\grad{f}) \\tag{iii} \\div{(\\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B})} = \\vec{B} \\cdot (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) \\tag{iv} and two for curls: \\curl{(f\\vec{A})} = f(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cross (\\grad{f}) \\tag{v} \\curl{(\\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B})} = (\\vec{B} \\cdot \\grad{})\\vec{A} - (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\grad{}) \\vec{B} + \\vec{A}(\\div{\\vec{B}}) - \\vec{B}(\\div{\\vec{A}}) \\tag{vi} If there's anything in this chapter that's worth memorizing, it is this set of identities. The proofs come straight from the product rule for ordinary derivatives. For instance, \\begin{align*} \\div{(f\\vec{A})} & = \\pdv{}{x} (f A_x) + \\pdv{}{y} (fA_y) + \\pdv{}{z}(f A_z) \\\\ & = \\left( \\pdv{f}{x} A_x + f \\pdv{A_x}{x} \\right) + \\left( \\pdv{f}{y} A_y + f \\pdv{A_y}{y} \\right) + \\left( \\pdv{f}{z}A_z + f \\pdv{A_z}{z} \\right) \\\\ & = (\\grad{f}) \\cdot \\vec{A} + f(\\div{\\vec{A}}) \\end{align*} It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules: \\grad \\left( \\frac{f}{g} \\right) = \\frac{g \\grad{f} - f \\grad{g}}{g^2} \\div{\\left( \\frac{\\vec{A}}{g} \\right)} = \\frac{g(\\div{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\grad{g})}{g^2} \\curl \\left( \\frac{\\vec{A}}{g} \\right) = \\frac{g(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + \\vec{A} \\cross (\\grad{g})}{g^2} However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product rules, there is no point in listing them separately. 1.2.7: Second Derivatives The gradient, the divergence, and the curl are the only first derivatives we can make with \\grad ; by applying \\grad twice, we can construct five species of second derivatives. The gradient \\grad{T} is a vector, so we can take the divergence and curl of it: Divergence of gradient: \\div (\\grad{T}) Curl of gradient: \\curl (\\grad{T}) The divergence \\div{\\vec{v}} is a scalar - all we can do is take its gradient: Gradient of divergence: \\grad (\\div{\\vec{v}}) The curl \\curl \\vec{v} is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl: Divergence of curl: \\div (\\curl \\vec{v}) Curl of curl: \\curl (\\curl \\vec{v}) This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give anything new. Let's consider them one at a time: \\begin{align*} \\div (\\grad{T}) & = \\left( \\vu{x} \\pdv{}{x} + \\vu{y} \\pdv{}{y} + \\vu{z} \\pdv{}{z} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\right) \\\\ & = \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial z^2} \\end{align*} \\tagl{1.42} This object, which we write as \\laplacian T for short, is called the Laplacian of T; we shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar T is a scalar. Occasionally we shall speak of the laplacian of a vector, \\laplacian \\vec{v} . By this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of v_x , and so in: \\laplacian \\vec{v} \\equiv (\\laplacian v_x) \\vu{x} + (\\laplacian v_y) \\vu{y} + (\\laplacian v_z) \\vu{z} \\tagl{1.43} This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of \\laplacian . The curl of a gradient is always zero : \\curl (\\grad{T}) = 0 \\tagl{1.44} This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it from the definition of \\grad , hinging on the equality of cross-derivatives: \\pdv{}{x} \\left( \\pdv{T}{y} \\right) = \\pdv{}{y} \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\right) \\tagl{1.45} \\grad(\\div{\\vec{v}}) seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given any special name of its own - it's just the gradient of the divergence . Notice that \\grad (\\div \\vec{v}) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vector: \\laplacian \\vec{v} = (\\div \\grad) \\vec{v} \\neq \\grad( \\div \\vec{v}) . The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero: \\div (\\curl \\vec{v}) = 0 \\tagl{1.46} You can prove this for yourself. As you can check from the definition of \\grad : \\curl (\\curl \\vec{v}) = \\grad(\\div \\vec{v}) - \\laplacian \\vec{v} \\tagl{1.47} So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the first term is just gradient of divergence, and the second is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, this is often used to define the Laplacian of a vector, in preference to \\eqref{1.43} which makes explicit reference to Cartesian coordinates.) Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Laplacian (which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which we seldom encounter). We could go through a similar ritual to work out third derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives suffice for practically all physical applications. A final word on vector differential calculus: It all flows from the operator \\grad , and from taking seriously its vectorial character. Even if you remembered only the definition of \\grad , you could easily reconstruct all the rest.","title":"1.2 - Particle motion in EM fields"},{"location":"ch1-2/#12-differential-calculus","text":"","title":"1.2: Differential Calculus"},{"location":"ch1-2/#121-ordinary-derivatives","text":"Suppose we have a function of one variable, f(x) .

(Start out in one comer, and set up a system of axes; then for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that spot.) We want to generalize the notion of \"derivative\" to functions like T, which depend not on one but on three variables. A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will prob- ably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. In fact, the question \"How fast does T vary?\" has an infinite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore. Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial derivatives states that \\dd{T} = \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\right)\\dd{x} + \\left( \\pdv{T}{y} \\right) \\dd{y} + \\left( \\pdv{T}{z} \\right) \\dd{z} \\tagl{1.34} This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the infinitesimal amounts dx, dy, dz. Notice that we do not require an infinite number of derivatives - three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three coordinate directions. \\eqref{1.34} is reminiscent of a dot product: \\dd{T} = \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\right)\\cdot ( \\dd{x} \\vu{x} + \\dd{y} \\vu{y} + \\dd{z} \\vu{z} \\\\ = (\\grad{T}) \\cdot (\\dd{\\vec{l}}) \\tagl{1.35} where \\grad{T} \\equiv \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\tagl{1.36} is the gradient of T. Note that \\grad{T} is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. \\eqref{1.35} is the three-dimensional version of \\eqref{1.33} . Geometrical interpretation of the Gradient : Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction . To determine its geometrical meaning, let's rewrite the dot product using Eq. 1.1 \\dd{T} = \\grad{T} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = |\\grad{T}| |\\dd{\\vec{l}}| \\cos \\theta \\tagl{1.37} where \\theta is the angle between \\grad{T} and \\dd{\\vec{l}} . Now if we fix the magnitude |\\dd{\\vec{l}}| and search around in various directions, the maximum change in T evidently occurs when \\theta = 0 (for then \\cos \\theta = 1 ). That is, for a fixed distance, dT is greatest when I move in the same direction as \\grad{T} . Thus: The gradient \\grad{T} points in the direction of maximum increase of the function T. Moreover: The magnitude | \\grad{T} | gives the slope (rate of increase) along this maximal direction Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and find the direction of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here the function we're talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions-latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles (\\theta = 90^{\\circ}) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines). You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have \"kinks\" in them, and correspond to non-differentiable functions. What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If \\grad{T} = 0 at (x, y, z), then \\dd{T} = 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y, z). This is, then, a stationary point of the function T(x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit), a minimum (a valley), a saddle point (a pass), or a \"shoulder.\" This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero.","title":"1.2.2: Gradient"},{"location":"ch1-2/#example-13","text":"Find the gradient of r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} (the magnitude of the position vector) Solution \\begin{align*} \\grad{r} & = \\pdv{r}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{r}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{r}{z} \\vu{z} \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{y} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2z}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\\vu{z} \\\\ & = \\frac{x \\vu{x} + y \\vu{y} + z \\vu{z}}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{r} = \\vu{r} \\end{align*} Does this makes sense?

A whirlpool would be a region of large curl.","title":"1.2.5: The Curl"},{"location":"ch1-2/#example-15","text":"Suppose the function sketched in Fig 1.19a is \\vec{v_a} = -y \\vu{x} + x \\vu{y} , and that in Fig 1.19b is \\vec{v_b} = x \\vu{y} .

Thus, \\grad{(f + g)} = \\grad{f} + \\grad{g}, \\qquad \\div{(\\vec{A} + \\vec{B})} = (\\div{\\vec{A}}) + (\\div{\\vec{B}}) \\curl{(\\vec{A} + \\vec{B})} = (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) and \\grad{(kf)} = k \\grad f, \\quad \\div{(k\\vec{A})} = k (\\div{\\vec{A}}), \\quad \\curl{(k\\vec{A})} = k(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions: fg \\quad \\text{(product of two scalar functions),} \\\\ \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\quad \\text{(dot product of two vector functions),} and two ways to make a vector: f \\vec{A} \\quad \\text{(scalar times vector),} \\\\ \\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B} \\quad \\text{(cross product of two vectors).} Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients: \\grad{(fg)} = f \\grad{g} + g \\grad{f} \\tag{i} \\grad( \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B}) = \\vec{A} \\cross (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) + \\vec{B} \\cross (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\grad{})\\vec{B} + (\\vec{B} \\cdot \\grad{}) \\vec{A} \\tag{ii} two for divergences: \\div{(f\\vec{A})} = f(\\div{\\vec{A}}) + \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\grad{f}) \\tag{iii} \\div{(\\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B})} = \\vec{B} \\cdot (\\curl{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\curl{\\vec{B}}) \\tag{iv} and two for curls: \\curl{(f\\vec{A})} = f(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cross (\\grad{f}) \\tag{v} \\curl{(\\vec{A} \\cross \\vec{B})} = (\\vec{B} \\cdot \\grad{})\\vec{A} - (\\vec{A} \\cdot \\grad{}) \\vec{B} + \\vec{A}(\\div{\\vec{B}}) - \\vec{B}(\\div{\\vec{A}}) \\tag{vi} If there's anything in this chapter that's worth memorizing, it is this set of identities. The proofs come straight from the product rule for ordinary derivatives. For instance, \\begin{align*} \\div{(f\\vec{A})} & = \\pdv{}{x} (f A_x) + \\pdv{}{y} (fA_y) + \\pdv{}{z}(f A_z) \\\\ & = \\left( \\pdv{f}{x} A_x + f \\pdv{A_x}{x} \\right) + \\left( \\pdv{f}{y} A_y + f \\pdv{A_y}{y} \\right) + \\left( \\pdv{f}{z}A_z + f \\pdv{A_z}{z} \\right) \\\\ & = (\\grad{f}) \\cdot \\vec{A} + f(\\div{\\vec{A}}) \\end{align*} It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules: \\grad \\left( \\frac{f}{g} \\right) = \\frac{g \\grad{f} - f \\grad{g}}{g^2} \\div{\\left( \\frac{\\vec{A}}{g} \\right)} = \\frac{g(\\div{\\vec{A}}) - \\vec{A} \\cdot (\\grad{g})}{g^2} \\curl \\left( \\frac{\\vec{A}}{g} \\right) = \\frac{g(\\curl{\\vec{A}}) + \\vec{A} \\cross (\\grad{g})}{g^2} However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product rules, there is no point in listing them separately.","title":"1.2.6: Product Rules"},{"location":"ch1-2/#127-second-derivatives","text":"The gradient, the divergence, and the curl are the only first derivatives we can make with \\grad ; by applying \\grad twice, we can construct five species of second derivatives. The gradient \\grad{T} is a vector, so we can take the divergence and curl of it: Divergence of gradient: \\div (\\grad{T}) Curl of gradient: \\curl (\\grad{T}) The divergence \\div{\\vec{v}} is a scalar - all we can do is take its gradient: Gradient of divergence: \\grad (\\div{\\vec{v}}) The curl \\curl \\vec{v} is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl: Divergence of curl: \\div (\\curl \\vec{v}) Curl of curl: \\curl (\\curl \\vec{v}) This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give anything new. Let's consider them one at a time: \\begin{align*} \\div (\\grad{T}) & = \\left( \\vu{x} \\pdv{}{x} + \\vu{y} \\pdv{}{y} + \\vu{z} \\pdv{}{z} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\vu{x} + \\pdv{T}{y} \\vu{y} + \\pdv{T}{z} \\vu{z} \\right) \\\\ & = \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial ^2 T}{\\partial z^2} \\end{align*} \\tagl{1.42} This object, which we write as \\laplacian T for short, is called the Laplacian of T; we shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar T is a scalar. Occasionally we shall speak of the laplacian of a vector, \\laplacian \\vec{v} . By this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of v_x , and so in: \\laplacian \\vec{v} \\equiv (\\laplacian v_x) \\vu{x} + (\\laplacian v_y) \\vu{y} + (\\laplacian v_z) \\vu{z} \\tagl{1.43} This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of \\laplacian . The curl of a gradient is always zero : \\curl (\\grad{T}) = 0 \\tagl{1.44} This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it from the definition of \\grad , hinging on the equality of cross-derivatives: \\pdv{}{x} \\left( \\pdv{T}{y} \\right) = \\pdv{}{y} \\left( \\pdv{T}{x} \\right) \\tagl{1.45} \\grad(\\div{\\vec{v}}) seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given any special name of its own - it's just the gradient of the divergence . Notice that \\grad (\\div \\vec{v}) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vector: \\laplacian \\vec{v} = (\\div \\grad) \\vec{v} \\neq \\grad( \\div \\vec{v}) . The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero: \\div (\\curl \\vec{v}) = 0 \\tagl{1.46} You can prove this for yourself. As you can check from the definition of \\grad : \\curl (\\curl \\vec{v}) = \\grad(\\div \\vec{v}) - \\laplacian \\vec{v} \\tagl{1.47} So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the first term is just gradient of divergence, and the second is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, this is often used to define the Laplacian of a vector, in preference to \\eqref{1.43} which makes explicit reference to Cartesian coordinates.) Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Laplacian (which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which we seldom encounter). We could go through a similar ritual to work out third derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives suffice for practically all physical applications. A final word on vector differential calculus: It all flows from the operator \\grad , and from taking seriously its vectorial character. Even if you remembered only the definition of \\grad , you could easily reconstruct all the rest.","title":"1.2.7: Second Derivatives"}]}
