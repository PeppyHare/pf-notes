### Internals

All content is written in Markdown and rendered to a static site using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The theme for the site is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). TeX content is rendered at build time using [KaTeX](https://katex.org) so that page loading is super speedy for the client.
