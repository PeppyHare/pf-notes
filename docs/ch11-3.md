# Oscillations

## Collision Frequencies

Gases have three degrees of freedom to oscillate, but plasmas have four: the electron fluid adds an additional parameter. 


One way to see how the electron fluid oscillates, take a region of plasma and displace the electrons by a distance \( x \) and release. Then, watch how the electrons oscillate.

Gauss's law gives the resulting electric field (same as a parallel-plate capacitor.

$$
E = \frac{n e x}{\epsilon_0}
$$

The restoring force is therefore

$$
F = \frac{x n e^2}{\epsilon_0}
$$

We know forces of that form. When released, it will undergo simple harmonic motion

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{K}{m}} \qquad K = \frac{ ne^2}{\epsilon_0}
$$

We define the plasma frequency as

$$
\omega_{pe} = \sqrt{ \frac{ne^2}{m_e \epsilon_0}}
$$

If we take the displacement out to \( \lambda_D \) then the peak velocity is the electron thermal speed \( v_e \) 

$$
\omega_{pe} \lambda_D = v_e
$$

Taking a look back at the collision frequencies, the electron-electron collision frequency \( \nu_{ee} \) (associated with the energy transfer) is close to the electron-ion collision frequency \( \nu_{ei} \) associated with momentum transfer, and both are about

$$
\nu_{ee} \approx \nu_{ei} \approx \frac{v_e}{\lambda_D \Lambda} = \frac{\omega_{pe}}{\Lambda}
$$

So the electron-electron collision frequency will be much less than the plasma frequency if \( \Lambda \gg 1 \) 

$$
\Lambda \gg 1 \rightarrow \nu_{ee} \ll \omega_{pe}
$$


# Radiation

## Cyclotron radiation

As an electron moves through a magnetic field, it takes a helical path. The acceleration is

$$
\vec a = \frac{v^2}{r} = v_{th} \omega _c
$$

Only the component of \( \vec a \) perpendicular to \( r \) can cause radiation in the \( r \) direction. 

# \( \theta \)-pinch

Called theta-pinch because current \( I \) is in the \( \theta \) direction. The magnetic field is constant within the plasma, and constant outside the plasma (inside the device). 

$$
\frac{B_0 ^2}{2 \mu_0} 
$$

# Z-pinch

Talk about a Z-pinch that's stationary and compressing. Assume T is a constant (burning through). The radiated power is then
$$
P_{rad} \propto n^2
$$

The ohmic heating goes like \( j^2 \) 
$$
P_{ohmic} \propto j^2
$$

So the key parameter in the ratio is \( j/n \).

There is no \( B_{\parallel} \) so we need to balance the pressure as well.

Consider ohmically heating a pure Z-pinch like FRC or ZaP.

First, assume that the power radiated per unit volume goes like
$$
n^2 f (T) = P/V
$$

The dependence is true for a fixed impurity fraction for line radiation in steady state, and for Bremsstrahlung.

Ignore \( \ln \Lambda \) dependency in ohmic heating so

$$
P/V = \eta(T) j^2
$$

The pressure balance demands

$$
\frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} = p = 2 nk T_0
$$

For Bremsstrahlung temperature and density dependence are

$$
P_{rad} = c_1 n^2 T^{1/2}
$$
$$
P_{ohm} = c_2 j^2 T^{-3/2}
$$
Pressure balance

$$
n T \propto B^2 \propto j^2 r^2
$$
$$
nT = c_3 j^2 r^2
$$
$$
T = c_e \frac{j^2 r^2}{n}
$$

So if we're going to get any heating, we need the ohmic heating to be greater than the radiation

$$
c_2 j^2 T^{-3/2} \geq c_1 n^2 T^{1/2}
$$

using

$$
T = c_3 \frac{j^2 r^2}{n}
$$

$$
\rightarrow \frac{c_2}{c_1 c_3 ^2} > j^2 r^4 \sim I^2
$$

Density cancels out, and we're left with a current term (\( I^2 \))  called the Pease current

$$
I \leq \approx 1 MA
$$

Z-pinch radiatively collapses above 1MA for Bremsstralung radiation. Counter-intuitively, the current must be _less_ than the Pease current in order to continue heating. There is an even lower current for line radiation going up through the burn-through curve.

## Skin Depths in Plasma

Two types of skin depths in plasma: collisional and collisionless

$$
\delta = \sqrt{ \frac{ 2}{\mu_0 \omega \sigma}} \quad \text{Collisional}
$$

$$
\delta = \frac{c}{\omega_{pe}} \quad \text{Electron collisionless skin depth}
$$

$$
\delta = \frac{c}{\omega_{pi}} \quad \text{Ion collisionless skin depth}
$$

Collisionless skin depth is due to electron inertia, which allows the field to penetrate even if it is very hot and a good conductor. What is magnitude? Look at E production and B shielding

$$
\curl E = - \pdv{B}{t}
$$

$$
\curl B = \mu_0 j + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \pdv{E}{t}
$$

Electrons accelerate with E 

$$
m \pdv{v}{t} = E e
$$

Doing a wave analysis assuming spatial solutions that decay off as \( 1 / \delta \) and oscillate with frequency \( \omega \), we have

$$
\frac{1}{\delta} \sim \grad
$$
$$
\omega \sim \pdv{}{t}
$$

$$
\frac{E}{\delta} = - \omega B
$$

$$
m \omega v = - e E
$$

$$
j = - n e v
$$

$$
\frac{B}{\delta} = \mu_0 (- n e v) + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \omega E = \frac{E}{\delta ^2 \omega}
$$
$$
\frac{E}{\delta ^2 \omega} = \frac{\mu_0 n e^2}{m} \frac{E}{\omega} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \omega E
$$

That's the dispersion relation for our wave solutions. Plugging in \( c \) 
$$
- \frac{c^2}{\delta ^2} \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{n e^2}{\epsilon_0 m }\frac{1}{\omega} + \omega
$$

That lets us identify the electron plasma frequency
