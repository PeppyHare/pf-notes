# Method of Lines

When we performed von Neumann stability analysis, we made use of Fourier transforms to transform our discrete domain into a continuous wave space. Implicit in our analysis was the assumption that we had a periodic domain. Clearly in some situations we have different boundary conditions, so how do the Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions alter our algorithm's stability?
