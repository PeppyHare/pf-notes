# Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods

Finite volume methods can easily handle arbitrary geometries. You can use arbitrarily shaped cells, irregular meshes, and even unstructured meshes. With an irregular mesh, the cell shapes can distort. In an unstructured mesh, the cell shape can even change. Why would you ever want that, you may ask? Consider a circular shape in the middle of our domain. We'll have a pretty hard time fitting a regular or even irregular mesh to a circle.

## Differential Operators

Starting with a 2-dimensional domain, the divergence operator can be discretized as

$$
\div F = \pdv{F_x}{x} + \pdv{F_y}{y} = \frac{F_{x_{i+1, j}} - F_{x _{i-1, j}}}{2 \Delta x} + \frac{ F_{y_{i, j+1}} - F_{y _{i, j-1}}}{2 \Delta y}
$$

In a finite volume method, we need to integrate the differential operators over a cell volume

$$
\int_V \div \vec{F} \dd V = \oint \vec{\dd S} \cdot \vec{F}
$$
$$
= \sum_{\text{faces}} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{\dd S}
$$
