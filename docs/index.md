### Internals

All content is written in Markdown and rendered to a static site using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The theme for the site is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). I use python-markdown-math to turn any LaTeX in my source into full-blown MathJax to be rendered in the browser (and in a mobile-friendly format!).
