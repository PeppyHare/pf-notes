# Plasma Models

## Ideal MHD

Let's start from a full-particle description with the goal of reaching a continuum description (kinetic model). Then, we'll look at the forces on the separate species and form a multi-fluid model, finally simplifying to a single-fluid MHD model.

The most important question to ask ourselves is "when is this model going to be useful?" The MHD model is the mathematical model for magnetized plasmas that are treated as a fluid. This means that we can define a fluid element (some lil' box of plasma) and define the physical properties (mass, density, magnetization, etc.) of the element. We need to make some assumptions about scale in order to do this. In terms of spatial scales, we abstract properties below a discrete scale \( a_0 \)  into the properties of a fluid element

$$
\frac{a_0}{L} \rightarrow 0 \qquad a_0 = \text{discrete scale} \qquad L = \text{spatial scale of interest}
$$

Length scales smaller than the discrete scale will not be properly captured by the model, so scales like the particle radius will be meaningless in our fluid model.

## Plasma Definition

A plasma is a quasi-neutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibit _collective behavior_. The particles (electrons, ions, neutrals) interact through EM fields and collisions.

Mathematically you would think that plasmas could be treated as individual particles. Doing so gives an N-body problem with classical interactions through the Lorentz force (Coulomb interaction removed by assumption of quasi-neutrality) and binary collisions. Each particle \( i \)  has a well-defined mass \( m_i \)  and charge \( q_i \)  which do not change in time. The governing equations are

$$
\dv{\vec v_i}{t} = \frac{q_i}{m_i} (\vec E + \vec v_i \cross \vec B) + \sum_{j \neq i} \left[ \left. \dv{\vec v_{ij}}{t} \right|_{coll} (\vec r_i - \vec r_j) \right]
$$
$$
\dv{\vec r_i}{t} = \vec v_i
$$

The fields E and B are described by the Maxwell equations

$$
\pdv{B}{t} = - \curl E
$$
$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{E}{t} = \curl B - \mu_0 \sum_i q_i v_i \delta (r - r_i)
$$
$$
\div B = 0
$$
$$
\epsilon_0 \div E = \sum_i q_i \delta (r - r_i)
$$

## Klimontovich Equation

Re-writing the force relations as a statement of conservation in phase space, we get Klimontovich equation for species \( \alpha \) 

$$
\dv{N_\alpha}{t} = 0 = \pdv{N_\alpha}{t} + \pdv{}{q} \cdot (\dot{q} N_\alpha) + \pdv{}{p} \cdot (\dot{p}N_\alpha)
$$

The particle phase space is defined by 
$$
N_\alpha(p, q) = \sum_i \delta(p - p_i) \delta(q - q_i)
$$
where \( p \) and \( q \) are generalized momentum and position coordinates. The resulting \( N(p) \) looks very spiky, with nonzero values only at the exact values inhabited by particles. Unfortunately, that means that only the tools of discrete mathematics are applicable to the distribution, and we're forbidden from our favorite tool (calculus). To make the analysis possible, we can smooth over the discreteness by performing an ensemble average of the Klimontovich equation. This gives us a statistical description using smooth distribution functions:

$$
f(x, v, t) \qquad \frac{(\text{no. of particles})}{(\text{unit distance})^3(\text{unit velocity})^3}
$$

That is, \( f(x, v, t) \) is the number of particles at position \( x \) with velocity \( v \) at time \( t \). We also work with normalized distributions which give the probability of finding a particle.

By our definition, we can integrate to get the total number of particles at time \( t \).

$$
\int \int \dd x \dd v f(x, v, t) = N(t)
$$

The ensemble averaging process works well if the the number of particles is very large

$$
N \gg 1
$$

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.1" src="../img/12.1.png" /> </p>

See a kinetic theory text (e.g. Krall and Trivelpiece) for a full description of the ensemble averaging process.

Now we can write our Klimontovich equation in terms of continuous quantities

$$
\pdv{f}{t} + \left[ \pdv{}{q} \cdot (\dot{q} f) + \pdv{}{p} \cdot (\dot{p}f) \right] = \text{(cross terms)}
$$

The collision terms now have an infinite number of cross terms. We call this the BBGKY (Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon) hierarchy.

Expressing as the Boltzmann equation (generally called the Boltzmann-Maxwell equation, since the solution requires solving for the electromagnetic fields of the Maxwell equations)

$$
\pdv{f_\alpha}{t} + \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} + \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} = \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll}
$$

We leave the collision term in. A lot of the work of kinetic theory is coming up with an applicable form of the collision operator which is appropriate but still simple enough to solve. We often write the collision operator as the product of binary collisions

$$
 \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = \sum_\beta C_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Notice that the terms \( \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \) and \( \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \) are advection equations, advecting in \( \vec x \) and \( \vec v \) respectively. If we ignore the collision term (set the RHS to zero) we have the Vlasov equation.

Note that the fields E and B at any location are generated from the charges and currents of the entire plasma volume, including externally applied fields. As a result, there's an inherent integrating process taking into account the sources across the whole volume that leads to long-range smoothly varying forces. This is in contrast to the collisional effects, which by their nature lead to very short range abrupt forces. It makes sense to make a distinction between the long-range electromagnetic forces and the short range collisional forces.

Because the Boltzmann-Maxwell model is inherently 6-dimensional, it is a very challenging model to implement. The B-M model provides a complete description, but it is often too detailed to solve.

If we solve the Vlasov equation for two parallel opposite beams, for example, we see that the 

As it turns out, the integral, centroid, and variance are all that are required to fully describe a Maxwellian distribution

$$
f_{M, \alpha} (\vec v) = n_0 \left( \frac{ m_\alpha }{2 \pi T_\alpha} \right)^{3/2} \text{exp}\left[ - \frac{ \frac{1}{2} m_\alpha (v - v_\alpha)^2}{T_\alpha} \right]
$$

In other words, we can write the Maxwellian distribution as \( f_M(n_0, \vec v_\alpha, T_\alpha ; \vec v) \). We care about Maxwellian distributions so much in plasma physics because it is the solution to the Boltzmann equation for \( \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = 0 \) (Vlasov equation). That's not saying that there are no collisions, it is saying that there are so many collisions that the effect is isotropic and the overall force is zero.

Another feature of the Maxwellian distribution is \( \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} = 0 \). This is a famous result called the Boltzmann H-theorem, and says that any initial distribution will relax (and very quickly) to a Maxwellian distribution.

By replacing our velocity distribution with the associated Maxwell distribution, we arrive at a Plasma Fluid Model 

## Plasma Fluid Model

We take velocity moments of each of the pieces of the kinetic model:
  - distribution function, \( f_\alpha \) \( \rightarrow \) fluid variables
  - Boltzmann Equation \( \rightarrow \) governing equations describing the evolution of the fluid variables.

Starting with the zeroth moment (integral) of the distribution function:

$$
\int f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = n_\alpha(\vec x, t)
$$

1st Moment (momentum):

$$
m_\alpha \int \vec v \cdot  f_\alpha(\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = \vec p_\alpha (\vec x, t) = m_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha
$$

which is to say that the velocity is the 1st moment divided by the zeroth moment

$$
v_\alpha = \frac{\int \vec v f_\alpha}{\int f_\alpha}
$$

2nd Moment:

$$
\int \vec v \vec v f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = \vec E_\alpha(\vec x, t) (\text{energy tensor})
$$

We can simplify the 2nd moment by taking a reduced 2nd moment. This means that we're going to insert a dot product

$$
\int \vec v \cdot \vec v f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v
$$

Before moving forward, we want to define a "random" velocity. Note that

$$
\int \vec v f_\alpha - \vec v_\alpha \int f_\alpha = 0 \rightarrow \int (\vec v - \vec v_\alpha) f_\alpha \dd \vec v = 0
$$

We can define a random velocity \( \vec w = \vec v - \vec v_\alpha \). It is random in the sense that it is a fluctuation about the mean velocity, and when we integrate it we get zero. We can use this to define the energy tensor using the mean velocity to get a meaningful result. The pressure tensor is the second moment, using the random velocity

$$
\vec P_\alpha = m_\alpha \int \vec w \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v = P_\alpha \overline{I} + \overline{\Pi}_\alpha
$$

where we've decomposed the pressure into an isotropic value \( P_\alpha \) and what's called the Braginskii stress tensor \( \overline{Pi}_\alpha \). The average isotropic pressure is given by the reduced 2nd moment:

$$
P_\alpha = n_\alpha T_\alpha = \frac{1}{3} \int m_\alpha \vec w \cdot \vec w f_\alpha
$$

where the factor of \( 1/3 \) comes from the number of degrees of freedom in our system. It is related to the thermodynamic factor \( \gamma \) where \( \gamma = \frac{DOF + 2}{DOF} \). Now we can define the temperature \( T_\alpha \) as

$$
T_\alpha (\vec x, t) = \frac{1}{DOF} \frac{\int m_\alpha \vec w \cdot \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v}{\int f_\alpha \dd \vec v}
$$

Now that we've got \( n_\alpha \), \( v_\alpha \), and \( T_\alpha \) we have what we need to define a Maxwellian distribution. Higher moments would be required to describe non-Maxwellian distribution functions. For example, the 3rd moment is called the skewness of the distribution. The 4th moment is the kurtosis. So on and so forth. These give a measure of degree of departure from a Maxwellian distribution, in which case it is often more useful to talk about the excess kurtosis, where the excess kurtosis of a Maxwellian is defined to be zero. You can continue to calculate the moment expansion, and in general it requires an infinite number of moments to describe an arbitrary distribution function. Because of the Boltzmann H-theorem and the tendency of plasmas to quickly relax to Maxwellian, we can usually get away with using just the first three moments.

Now, what are the governing equations? We get these by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation. Let's proceed carefully in sections, so we'll integrate each piece of the BE in terms.

### 0th Moment of Boltzmann Equation (Conservation)

$$
\int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v + \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} \dd \vec v
$$

First, we take \( \int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v \). Because t and v are both independent variables, with an argument of sufficient smoothness we can reverse the order of integration and differentiation

$$
\int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t}\int f_\alpha \dd v = \pdv{n_\alpha}{t}
$$

For \(  \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v \) we can perform an integration by parts

$$ \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \vec v \dd \vec v \\
 = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v  \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) = \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha)
$$

Once again, we've switched the order of integration of \( x \)  and \( v \), which we can only do because we have specified that \( f \) is a distribution function, and as such meets the criterion of sufficient smoothness.

For the last part, we can write it as a surface integral

$$
\int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \oint f_\alpha \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} ( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \dd S_v - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \dd \vec v
$$

For \( f_\alpha \) to be well-defined, we require \( \lim_{v \rightarrow \infty} v^3 f_\alpha = 0 \) so the surface term vanishes and we're left with

$$
\int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \dd \vec v 
$$

Distributing the divergence through, 

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \vec E = 0
$$
because \( \vec E \) is independent of \( \vec v \).

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot ( \vec v \cross \vec B) = 0
$$
because \( \vec v \cross \vec B \) is always orthogonal to \( \vec v \).

We've been working through this in normal vector notation for familiarity, but there is another notation known as Einstein Tensor Notation using the lovely Levi-Civita symbol \( \epsilon_{ijk} \).

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} = 1 \qquad \text{even permutations of i j k} \\
 = -1 \qquad \text{odd permutations of i j k} \\
= 0 \qquad \text{any repeated indexes}
$$


We can write out vector products as products of indices and operators, and any repeated indices are implicitly summed:

$$
\vec v \cross \vec B = \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k = \sum_{jk} \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k
$$

where \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) is defined to be 1 for even permutations of ijk, -1 for negative permutations if ijk, and 0 for any repeated indices.

We can now write the derivative with respect to \( \vec v \) as

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \vec v \cross \vec B = \partial _{v_i} \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k \\
= \epsilon_{ijk} (\partial_{v_i} v_j) B_k
$$

We see that we're taking the derivative of the j-th component of velocity with respect to the i-th component of velocity, and _that's_ how we can most easily point out that the quantity is zero without relying on properties of 3-vector products.

We'll also want to use the divergence in Einstein tensor notation

$$
\div \vec A = \partial_i A_j \delta_{ij} = \partial_i A_i
$$

Finally, we come back to the collision term in the zeroth moment of the B-M equation

$$
\sum_\beta \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = 0
$$

We can say the collision term is zero by making a physical argument, rather than a mathematical one. We assert that collisions cannot create or destroy particles. This assumption is now baked into our equations going forward, but is not always true! Ionization, recombination, fusion reactions all create/destroy species.

Finally, we've got

$$
\pdv{n_\alpha}{t} + \div ( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) = 0 \qquad \text{continuity equation}
$$

So by taking the 0th moment of the Boltzmann Equation, we've arrived at the continuity equation for \( n_\alpha \) by introducing \( \vec v_\alpha \).

### 1st Moment of Boltzmann Equation

$$
\int \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \vec v  \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \left. \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll}
$$

Term 1:

$$
\int \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t} \int \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v - \int \pdv{\vec v}{t} f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{t} \left( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \right)
$$

Before we get to the second term, let's have an aside about dyad math. An outer product \( \vec A \vec B \) gives a second-rank tensor. In Cartesian coordinates, it looks like

$$
\vec A \vec B = \begin{bmatrix}
A_x B_x & A_x B_y & A_x B_z \\
A_y B_x & A_y B_y & A_y B_z \\
A_z B_x & A_z B_y & A_z B_z \\
 \end{bmatrix}
$$

A useful property to do with dot products:

$$
\vec A \vec B \cdot \vec C = \vec A ( \vec B \cdot \vec C ) = (\vec A \vec B) \cdot \vec C
$$

$$
( \vec V \cdot \grad) \vec B = \vec V \cdot ( \grad \vec B)
$$

Back to term 2:

$$
\int \vec v \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v = \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{}{\vec x} ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int \vec v f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \vec v \dd \vec v \\
 = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int \vec v f_\alpha \cdot \pdv{\vec v}{\vec x} \dd \vec v \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int \vec v \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v
$$

Re-expanding in terms of random velocity \( \vec v = \vec v_\alpha + \vec w \)

$$
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int (\vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha + \vec v_\alpha \vec w + \vec w \vec v_\alpha  + \vec w \vec w)  f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left[ \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \int f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \vec v_\alpha \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \left( \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right) \vec v_\alpha + \int \vec w \vec w f_\alpha f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right]
$$

The middle two terms are zero by the very definition of \( \vec v_\alpha \). The random velocity \( \vec w \) is defined such that the integral of the random velocity over all phase space is zero.

$$
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left( \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha n_\alpha \right) + \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \frac{ \vec P_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \\
= \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \div \vec P_\alpha
$$

Substituting in the pressure tensor,

$$
= \div ( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha ) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \left( \grad P_\alpha  + \div \vec \Pi _\alpha \right)
$$

Moving on to term 3:

$$
\int \vec v \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) f_\alpha \right] \vec v \dd \vec v - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[ \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B \right] \vec v \dd \vec v \\
= \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[ f_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \vec v \right] \dd \vec v - \int \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} f ( \vec E + \vec v\alpha \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{\vec v}{\vec v} \dd \vec v \\
= \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} \oint f\alpha ( \vec E + \vec v\alpha \cross \vec B) \vec v \cdot \dd \vec S_v - \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} \left[ \vec E \int f \dd \vec v\alpha - \vec B \cross \int \vec v f\alpha \dd \vec v \right] \\
= - \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} n\alpha (\vec E + v\alpha \cross \vec B)
$$

Finally, the 4th term gives

$$
 \int \left. \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = \sum_\beta \int \vec v C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \\
= \int \vec v C_{\alpha \alpha} \dd \vec v + \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \int \vec v C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$

Collisions of like particles \( \alpha \) do not result in a net change of momentum of species \( \alpha \), so all we have left is the change in momentum due to collisions of unlike particles

$$
= \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \left[ \vec v_{\alpha} \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v + \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \right]
$$

For the same reason as before, we assert that collisions between particles \( \alpha \)  and \( \beta \)  do not lead to the creation or destruction of any species, so the 0th moment \( \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = 0\). This leads to the conclusion that only random motion contributes to momentum transfer, not \( \vec v_\alpha \). Viscosity and friction are good examples of similar physical processes where bulk velocity does not transfer momentum, but random motion does.

The momentum transfer from \( \alpha \)  to \( \beta \) must equal transfer from \( \beta \) to \( \alpha \). Momentum is globally conserved.

$$
\int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = - \int \vec w C_{\beta \alpha} \dd \vec v
$$

Now we can finally write out the full momentum equation

$$
\pdv{}{t} (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha ) + \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \div \vec P_\alpha - \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} n_\alpha ( \vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$

The collision term is often represented as the momentum transfer vector \( \vec R_{\alpha \beta} \) to \( \alpha \) from \( \beta \).

$$
\vec R_{\alpha \beta} \equiv m_\alpha \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$
$$
\pdv{}{t} (m_\alpha n_\alpha v_\alpha) + \div (m_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \grad \vec P_{\alpha} + \div \vec \Pi_{\alpha} - q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta} R_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Once again, we've written the above in a conservation law form. The terms that aren't strictly conservation terms are the source term \( q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) \) and sink term \( \sum_{\beta} R_{\alpha \beta} \).

Introducing the mass density

$$
\rho_\alpha = m_\alpha n_\alpha \qquad \text{mass density}
$$

$$
\pdv{}{t} (\rho_\alpha \vec v _\alpha) + \div (\rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha v_\alpha + \ldots \\
= \rho_\alpha \pdv{\vec v_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \left( \pdv{\rho_\alpha}{t} + \div \rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \right) + \rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha + \ldots
$$
The term in parentheses is just the continuity equation, which is zero, and what's left is a more usual form of the momentum equation

$$
\text{Momentum Equation:}\\
\rho_\alpha \left(\pdv{\vec v_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha \right) + \grad \vec P_\alpha + \div \vec \Pi_\alpha - q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v_\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \vec R_{\alpha \beta}
$$

So by taking the 1st moment of the BE, we arrive at the momentum equation for \( \vec v_\alpha \) and we have introduced \( \vec P_\alpha \).

### Momentum transfer (collisions)

Looking back at \( \vec R_{\alpha \beta} \), it's worth noting that the actual situation is complicated by the potential for multi-body collisions. While it is true that the probability of, e.g. three-body collisions is small, but there are many three-body collisional processes which are extremely important in plasma physics. Three-body recombination is the primary loss term in the ionization balance, for example. For now the simplest model is to only include binary collisions that result in small angel deflections. If we suppose we only have two species with distributions that look like the following:

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.2" src="../img/12.2.png" /> </p>

then we expect collisions between species to tend to drag the distributions towards each other. We should expect the collision-based momentum transfer to be proportional to the distance between the distributions, i.e. the total current density \( \vec j \).

For an ion-electron plasma, the collision momentum transfer vector (to ions from electrons) is

$$
\vec R_{ie} = - n_e e \eta \vec j
$$

where

$$
\eta = \frac{m_e \nu_{ei}}{n e^2} \qquad \text{resistivity}
$$

$$
\vec j = n e (\vec v_i - \vec v_e) \qquad \text {current density for Z = 1}
$$

### 2nd Moment of Boltzmann Equation

Finally we're on to our last expansion term. In general, we would say that the second moment would be

$$
\int \vec v \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t} \int \vec v \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t} \vec E_\alpha / m_\alpha \rightarrow \pdv{}{t} \vec P_\alpha
$$

Usually we think of the second moment as giving us energy, a scalar, rather than a tensor equation that we have here. Since the pressure tensor is symmetric, the energy equation will contain 6 independent quantities. Together with the continuity and velocity equations, we have 10 quantities in total, so we call this expansion a 10-moment expansion.

Instead of the full tensor equation, we're actually going to compute the _reduced 2nd moment_ by contracting \( \vec v \cdot \vec v \)

$$
\int \vec v \cdot \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd v
$$

So, let's get after it:

$$
\int v^2 \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v + \int v^2 \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v + \int v^2 \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \left. \int v^2 \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} \dd \vec v
$$

Simplifying... Term 1:

$$
\int v^2 \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \int \pdv{}{t} (v^2 f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int \pdv{v^2}{t} f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{t} \int (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) \cdot (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{t} \left[ \int v_\alpha ^2 f_\alpha \dd \vec v + 2 \int \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \int w^2 f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right] \\
= \pdv{}{t} \left[ v_\alpha ^2 \int f_\alpha \dd \vec v + 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + 3 \frac{n_\alpha T_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \right] \\
= \pdv{}{t} \left[ n_\alpha v_\alpha ^2 + 3 \frac{n_\alpha T_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \right]
$$

Term 2:

$$
\int v^2 \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot (v^2 \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot (v^2 \vec v) \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int ( \vec v_\alpha + \vec w) \cdot (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int (v_\alpha ^2 + 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec w + w^2) \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left[ \int v_\alpha ^2 (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \int 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec w (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \int w^2 (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right] \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left[ v_\alpha ^2 \vec v_\alpha \int f_\alpha \dd \vec v + v_\alpha ^2 \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \left(\int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right) \vec v_\alpha \\
\qquad + 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \int \vec w \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \vec v_\alpha \int w^2 f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \int \vec w w^2 f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right] \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot (n_\alpha v_\alpha ^2 \vec v_\alpha) + \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \frac{\vec P_\alpha}{m_\alpha} + \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left(\frac{3 n_\alpha T_\alpha \vec v_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \right) + \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left( \frac{2 \vec h_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \right)
$$

In keeping with the progression so far, the very last term would be something like a full 3rd moment \( \int \vec w \vec w \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v \). Instead, we have a "contracted 3rd moment" of the distribution \( \vec h_\alpha \) which is actually the _heat flux_, or the random energy flux of random energy.

Term 3:

$$
\int v^2 \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v \\
 = \oint f_\alpha \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} v^2 ( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \dd \vec S_v - \int f_\alpha \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[ v^2 ( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \right] \dd \vec v \\
= - \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \int f_\alpha \left[ v^2 \left(\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \vec E \right) + \left(\vec E \cdot \pdv{}{\vec v} v^2 \right) \right] \dd \vec v  \\
\qquad - \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha}\int f_\alpha \left[v^2 \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot (\vec v \cross \vec B) + \vec v \cross \vec B \cdot \pdv{}{\vec v} v^2 \right] \dd \vec v \\
= - \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \int f_\alpha (2 \vec E \cdot \vec v) \dd \vec v \\
= - \frac{2 q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec E
$$

We've ended up with the work done on a fluid by the electric field. As expected, there is no work term associated with the bulk magnetic field.

Term 4:

$$
\left. \int v^2 \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} \dd \vec v = \int v^2 C_{\alpha \alpha} \dd \vec v + \sum _{\beta \neq \alpha} \int v^2 C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v 
$$

We can make an energy conservation argument to get rid of the first term. The first term goes to 0 since collisions of like particles results in no net energy exchange.

$$
= \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \int ( \vec v_\alpha + \vec w) \cdot(\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \\
= \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha}\left( v_\alpha ^2 \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v + 2 \vec v_\alpha \cdot \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v + \int w^2 C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \right)
$$

Since collisions (we assume) don't create or destroy particles, the first term \( v_\alpha ^2 \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \) goes away. The second term \( \vec v_\alpha \cdot \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \) we interpret as a frictional force due to the relative motion between \( \alpha \)  and \( \beta \) 

$$
= \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} 2 \frac{\vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec R_{\alpha \beta}}{m_\alpha} + 2 \frac{Q_{\alpha \beta}}{m_\alpha}
$$

where \( Q_{\alpha \beta} \) is the heat exchange term (heat generation term in Braginskii). It describes the heat exchange by random collisions of unlike particles, analogous to viscous heating.

$$
Q_{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{2} \int m_\alpha w^2 C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$

If we were to draw distribution functions for species \( \alpha \)  and \( \beta \) (as shown), even though they have the same centroid they will interact by viscous heating. Species \( \beta \) will heat up and \( \alpha \) will cool

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.3" src="../img/12.3.png" /> </p>

If we multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} m_\alpha \) then the energy equation becomes

$$
\text{Energy Equation: } \\ \qquad \pdv{}{t} \left( \frac{3}{2} n_\alpha T_\alpha + \frac{1}{2} \rho_\alpha v_\alpha ^2 \right) + \\
 \div \left(\frac{3}{2} n_\alpha T_\alpha + \frac{1}{2} \rho_\alpha v_\alpha ^2 \right) \vec v_\alpha + \div (\vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec P_\alpha) + \div \vec h_\alpha - q_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec E \\ =  \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} (v_\alpha \cdot \vec R_{\alpha \beta} + Q_{\alpha \beta})
$$

Notice that the total energy appears

$$
E_\alpha = \frac{3}{2} n_\alpha T_\alpha + \frac{1}{2} \rho_\alpha v_\alpha ^2
$$

The factor of \( \frac{3}{2} \) as usual comes from \( \gamma \) 

$$
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} = \frac{1}{5/3 - 1}
$$

where

$$
\gamma = \frac{DOF + 2}{DOF} = \frac{5}{3}
$$

We can remove the kinetic portion of the energy equation by subtracting the product of the momentum equation with \( \vec v_\alpha \).

$$
\rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \cdot \pdv{v_\alpha}{t} = \frac{1}{2} \pdv{}{t} (\rho_\alpha v_\alpha ^2)
$$

$$
\pdv{}{t} \left( \frac{3}{2} n_\alpha T_\alpha \right) + \div \left(\frac{3}{2} n_\alpha T_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \right) + \div \left( \vec v_\alpha \cdot \vec P_\alpha \right) - \vec v_\alpha \cdot (\div \vec P_\alpha) + \div \vec h_\alpha = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} Q_{\alpha \beta}
$$
$$
\frac{3}{2} n_\alpha \left( \pdv{T_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \div T_\alpha \right) + \frac{3}{2} T_\alpha \left[ \pdv{n_\alpha}{t} + \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) \right] + \vec P_\alpha \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha + \div \vec h_\alpha = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} Q_{\alpha \beta}
$$
$$
\frac{3}{2} n_\alpha \left( \pdv{T_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \div T_\alpha \right) + \vec P_\alpha \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha + \div \vec h_\alpha = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} Q_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Where \( \vec P_\alpha \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha \) is a tensor contraction in two indices. It is a generalization of the dot product, i.e.
$$
\vec P_\alpha \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha = \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl} P_{ij} \partial_k v_l \\
= P_{xx} \partial_x v_x + P_{xy} \partial_y v_x + \ldots
$$

$$
\frac{3}{2} n_\alpha \left( \pdv{T_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad T_\alpha \right) + P_\alpha \div \vec v_\alpha + \vec \Pi_\alpha \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha + \div \vec h_\alpha = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} Q_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Now the continuity, momentum, and energy equations describe the evolution of each fluid \( \alpha \). The only velocity information we have retained in taking moments is the centroid \( \vec v_\alpha \) and the width \( T_\alpha \). This is the only information we will include in the 5-moment model (5N-moment plasma fluid model). The higher moments (describing skewness, kurtosis) are not evolved with the 5-moment model. There are fluid models that do evolve those moments, but we won't touch on those here.

### Closure Problem

We still need to "close" the fluid model (i.e. solving the **Closure Problem**). As we have been finding out, each additional moment of the Boltzmann Equation introduces the next-higher moment. In calculating the 0th moment, we introduce the 1st moment, etc. We need to address the closure problem by relating higher moment variables to lower moment variables. Applying a closure scheme (relating variables that are not evolved directly) is usually equivalent to making a statement on heat flow.

In our model, we are not evolving the heat flux \( \vec h_\alpha \), so we need to relate it to one of the other variables that we do evolve directly. We usually do that by writing down a conductivity relation

$$
\vec h_\alpha = - \kappa \grad T_\alpha
$$

for some conductivity \( \kappa \). 

We're also only evolving the scalar pressure, so we need to relate the stress tensor \( \vec Pi_\alpha \) to the other variables. We can do that with a viscosity relation

$$
\vec \Pi_\alpha = \nu \grad \vec v_\alpha
$$

for some viscosity \( \nu \). We call the introduced quantities \( \kappa \)  and \( \nu \) the **transport coefficients**. They are usually derived by performing an expansion of the equations we've already discussed. They are what lead to "nondimensional" numbers that characterize the flow in our system.

We can also achieve closure by constraining portions of the system. In an isothermal system

$$
\text{isothermal: } \quad T = \text{const.}, p \propto n
$$
$$
\text{adiabatic: } \quad  p \propto n^\gamma
$$
$$
\text{force-free, cold: } \quad p = 0
$$

The expressions that lead us to a closure scheme are the **equations of state**. They are not time-dependent, they simply relate fluid parameters to other properties of the system.

Maxwell's equations to couple the electromagnetic terms to the fluid variables.
$$
\pdv{\vec B}{t} = - \curl \vec E
$$
$$
\epsilon_0 \pdv{\vec E}{t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \vec B - \sum_{alpha} q_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha 
$$
$$
\epsilon_0 \div \vec E = \sum_\alpha q_\alpha n_\alpha 
$$
$$
\div \vec B = 0
$$

The fluid variables provide the source terms for Ampere's law and Gauss' law, and we've already seen how the electromagnetic fields appear in the momentum equations as source terms for the fluid forces.

### Stopping after the 2nd moment (5N-Moment Plasma Fluid Model)

What assumptions have we made by stopping here? It's important to know what they are and to recognize what they mean for the fluid model.

 - Each species \( \alpha \) is well-represented by a Maxwellian with a small perturbation. The pressure tensor is not strictly diagonal and the heat flux is not zero, so the small perturbations are what lead to the transport coefficients. This is due to the process by which we obtain the transport coefficients, called the Chapman-Enskog expansion.
 - Kinetic effects (stream instabilities, counter-flow instabilities, etc.) are not captured.

The variables of the 5-moment model that we _do_ evolve are 
$$
n, v_x, v_y, v_z, T
$$

We can take additional moments. The 10N-moment equation evolves, in addition to the quantities in the 5N-moment model, we evolve all of the independent terms of the pressure tensor
$$
n, v_x, v_y, v_z, P_{xx}, P_{xy}, P_{xz} , P_{yy} , P_{yz} , P_{zz} 
$$

The 13-N moment model has everything from the 10N-moment model plus the heat flux tensor \( h_x, h_y, h_z \) 


### Two-Fluid Plasma Model (ions-electrons)

Restricting our multi-species fluid model to ions and electrons, what can we say about wave behavior in a magnetized 2-fluid plasma? Let's start with a cold plasma approximation (\( p = 0 \)) and neglect collisions. The momentum equation reduces to

$$
m_\alpha \left( \pdv{\vec v_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha \right) - q_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v_\alpha \cross \vec B) = 0
$$

From here on out we can avoid some clutter (and wrist strain) by dropping the \( \alpha \) subscripts and acknowledging that we have sets of equations for ions and electrons. Apply a perturbation to an equilibrium \( g = g_0 + g_1 \) 

$$
m \left(\pdv{\vec v_0}{t} + \vec v_0 \cdot \grad \vec v_0 + \pdv{\vec v_0}{t} + \vec v_1 \cdot \grad \vec v_0 + \vec v_0 \cdot \grad \vec v_1 + \vec v_1 \cdot \grad \vec v_1 \right) \\
\qquad - q (E_0 + E_1) - q (\vec v_0 \cross \vec B_0 + \vec v_1 \cross \vec B_0 + \vec v_0 \cross \vec B_1 + \vec v_1 \cross \vec B_1) = 0
$$

We can drop some terms because equilibrium has to satisfy the original equation. We can balance all of the subscript-0 terms and sum them to get zero.

$$
m \left( \pdv{\vec v_1}{t} + \vec v_1 \cdot \grad \vec v_0 + \vec v_0 \cdot \grad \vec v_1 + \vec v_1 \cdot \grad \vec v_1 \right) + q (- E_1 - \vec v_1 \cross \vec B_0 - \vec v_0 \cross \vec B_1 - \vec v_1 \cross \vec B_1)
$$

Let's now make the assumption that the perturbation is small, that is \( g_1 \ll g_0 \). That means that nonlinear products of perturbation terms are negligible (linearization process). 

$$
m \left( \pdv{\vec v_1}{t} + \vec v_0 \cdot \grad \vec v_1 + \vec v_1 \cdot \grad \vec v_0 \right) - q \vec E_1 - q (\vec v_1 \cross \vec B_0 + \vec v_0 \cross \vec B_1) = 0
$$

Now, assume that the equilibrium is a **static equilibrium**, that is \( \vec v_0 = 0 \). If we decompose into components that are parallel and perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field \( \vec B_0 \), then 

$$
\pdv{v_{1, \parallel}}{t} - \frac{q}{m} E_{1, \parallel} = 0
$$
$$
\pdv{\vec v_{1, \perp}}{t} - \frac{q}{m} \left(\vec E_{1, \perp} + B_0 \vec v_{1, \perp} \cross \vu z \right) = 0
$$

The parallel component \( E_{1, \parallel} \) will lead us to the ordinary wave (**O-wave**). Consideration of the more general case with perpendicular components will lead to the **X-wave**. 

The plasma velocity is related to the fields through the current density (Maxwell equations). Faraday's law gives

$$
\pdv{\vec B}{t} = - \curl \vec E
$$
$$
\rightarrow \curl \pdv{\vec B}{t} = - \curl \curl \vec E = - \grad (\div \vec E) + \nabla ^2 \vec E 
$$

Ampere's law gives

$$
\epsilon_0 \pdv{\vec E}{t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \vec B - \sum_{\alpha} q_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha
$$
$$
\epsilon_0 \pdv{^2 \vec E }{t ^2} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \pdv{\vec B}{t} \\
= \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[ \nabla ^2 \vec E - \grad (\div \vec E) \right] - \sum_\alpha q_\alpha \pdv{}{t} (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) 
$$

Since this is a linear system, assume that the perturbed quantities have a wave-like structure. That is, the perturbed quantities \( g_1 \) are proportional to \( e^{i(\omega t + \vec k \cdot \vec r)} \). This lets us transform the spatial and temporal derivatives into factors of \( \omega \) and \( \vec k \) 

$$
- \epsilon_0 \omega ^2 \vec E_1 = - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left[k^2 \vec E_1 - \vec k (\vec k \cdot \vec E_1) \right] + i \omega e n_0 \vec v_1
$$

Let's now consider only high frequency oscillations, assuming that only the electrons respond and the ions remain stationary. There's nothing particularly complicated about including the ion response, this just lets us drop the \( \alpha \) subscripts and focus on a single set of equations.

$$
- i \omega \frac{e n_0}{\epsilon_0} \vec v_1 = (\omega ^2 - c^2 k^2) \vec E_1 + c^2 \vec k (\vec k \cdot \vec E_1)
$$

Now let's apply the perturbed form to the linearized momentum equation

$$
\pdv{v_{1, \parallel}}{t} - \frac{q}{m} E_{1, \parallel} = 0 \\
\rightarrow i \omega v_{1, \parallel} = - \frac{e}{m} E_{1, \parallel} \\
\rightarrow i \omega \frac{e n_0}{\epsilon_0} v_{1, \parallel} = \frac{e^2 n_0}{\epsilon_0 m} E_{1, \parallel}
$$

Combine the momentum equation and the Maxwell equations to eliminate \( \vec E_1 \) and \( \vec v_1 \)

$$
\frac{e^2 n_0}{\epsilon_0 m} E_{1, \parallel} = ( \omega ^2 - c^2 k^2 ) E_{1, \parallel} + c^2 k_{\parallel} \vec (k \cdot \vec E_1)
$$

Consider different possibilities for the \( \vec k \) vector. If it is along the magnetic field \( \vec k = k_{\parallel} \vu{e}_\parallel \) (longitudinal wave) then

$$
\frac{e^2 n_0}{\epsilon_0 m} = \omega ^2 - c^2 k^2 + c^2 k^2 = \omega_{pe}^2
$$

For \( \vec k = k_{\perp} \vu e_\perp \) (transverse wave) then we get the dispersion relation for the O-wave

$$
\text{dispersion relation for O-waves:} \qquad \omega^2 - c^2 k^2 = \omega_p ^2
$$

The electric field is in the same direction as the magnetic field \( (\vec E_1 = \vec E_{1, \parallel}) \), which means the O-wave is linearly polarized. At large \( k \) we just have regular light waves, but as we turn the frequency downwards we see a cut-off at the plasma frequency:

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.4" src="../img/12.4.png" /> </p>

It turns out that the dispersion relation for the X-wave has the same cut-off, but also has another branch with a resonance

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.5" src="../img/12.5.png" /> </p>



The two-fluid plasma model is highly reduced from the full kinetic model, but it is still too complete to be useful when studying gross plasma behavior. Further reductions of the model are possible by making asymptotic assumptions:

### Low-frequency Asymptotic Assumption

 - Eliminate high frequency, short wavelength phenomena by using pre-Maxwell field equations. Formally, this is \( \epsilon_0 \rightarrow 0 \). 

The direct consequences of the low-frequency approximation are

$$
c^2 = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0} \qquad c \rightarrow \infty
$$
$$
\omega_p ^2 = \frac{n e^2}{\epsilon_0 m} \qquad \omega_p \rightarrow \infty
$$
$$
\lambda_D = \frac{v_T}{\omega_p} \rightarrow 0
$$

This means that all phenomena will have \( \omega \ll \omega_p \), limiting the frequencies we can resolve to the ion plasma frequency. The characteristic speeds will be limited by the speed of light

$$
\frac{\omega}{k} \ll c
$$

and all characteristic lengths will be much greater than the Debye length

$$
x_0 \gg \lambda_D
$$

Looking at Gauss' law,
$$
\epsilon_0 \div \vec E = \sum_\alpha q_\alpha n_\alpha \rightarrow \sum_\alpha q_\alpha n_\alpha = 0
$$

so we now have charge neutrality everywhere in the domain. For H plasma, locally we have \( n_e = n_i \) everywhere.

Looking at Ampere's law,

$$
\epsilon_0 \pdv{\vec E}{t} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \vec B - \sum_\alpha q_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha = 0 \\
\rightarrow \vec j = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \vec B
$$

Things we do **not** get from this approximation are \( \vec E = 0 \) or \( \pdv{\vec E}{t} = 0 \). It does mean that plasma dynamics occur on a sufficiently large spatial scale that charge separation is small, and they occur on a sufficiently long temporal scale that electrons respond quickly.

### Tiny electron asymptotic assumption

2nd approximation: neglect electron inertia in the momentum equation. Formally, we let the electron mass \( m_e \rightarrow 0 \)

$$
\omega_{pe}^2 = \frac{n e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e} \rightarrow \infty
$$
$$
\omega_{c, e} = \frac{e B}{m_e} \rightarrow \infty
$$
$$
v_{T, e} \rightarrow \infty
$$
The Larmor radius goes to zero
$$
r_{l, e} = \frac{v_{T, e}}{\omega_{c, e}} \rightarrow 0
$$
Importantly, as the gyroradius \( r_{l, e} \) goes to 0 (because the thermal velocity goes as \( \sqrt{m_e} \) and the cyclotron frequency goes as \( m_e \)), this means that the electrons are tied to the magnetic field.
The skin depth is also small.
$$
\delta_e = \frac{c}{\omega_{p, e}} \rightarrow 0
$$

So all phenomena that we capture must have \( \omega \ll \omega_{p, e} \), \( \omega \ll \omega_{c, e} \), and \( x_0 \gg r_{L, e} \), \( x_0 \gg \delta_e \) .

The electron momentum equation becomes

$$
\grad P_e + \div \vec \Pi _e + e n_e (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \vec R_{\alpha \beta}
$$

The momentum equation is now a state equation, not an evolution equation. It now simply relates the dynamical variables to each other at any point in time.

Now, note that along magnetic field lines electrons can travel long distances at very fast (finite) speeds which can produce low frequency, long wavelength phenomena. Neglecting electron inertia implies that electrons respond instantaneously, meaning we cannot capture these modes. An example of such a phenomena is drift waves.

The characteristic speeds \( c \)  and \( v_{T, e} \) have disappeared from the model. Remaining is \( v_{T, i} \). This means that the ion dynamics dictate the plasma evolution.

# Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Model

Applying approximations to the two-fluid plasma model will allow us to arrive at a single-fluid (center-of-mass) description. The result is the ideal magnetohydrodynamic model (MHD).

First, define the MHD variables:

$$
\text{mass density:} \qquad \rho = n_i m_i + n_i m_e
$$

$$
\text{fluid velocity:} \qquad \vec v = \frac{n_i m_i \vec v_i + n_e m_e \vec v_e}{n_i m_i + n_e m_e}
$$

$$
\text{current density:} \qquad \vec j = q_i n_i \vec v_i - e n_e \vec v_e  \rightarrow \vec v_e = \frac{q_i n_i \vec v_i}{e n_e} - \vec j / e n_e
$$

$$
\text{total pressure:} \qquad p = p_i + p_e = n_e T_e + n_i T_i
$$

$$
\text{total temperature:} \qquad T = \frac{n_i T_i + n_e T_e}{(n_i + n_e)/2}
$$

Now let's begin applying asymptotic approximations. For the mass density, applying the first approx (charge neutrality) we have

$$
\rho \approx n (m_i + m_e)
$$

Using approx 2 (vanishing electron mass) 

$$
\rho \approx n m_i
$$
where
$$
n = n_i \qquad n_e = Z n
$$

The center-of-mass velocity (charge neutrality) gives

$$
\vec v \approx \frac{m_i \vec v_i + m_e Z \vec v_e}{m_i + Z m_e}
$$

with small electron mass approximation:

$$
\vec v \approx \vec v_i
$$

The current density is (charge neutrality approx)

$$
\vec j \approx Z e n (\vec v_i - \vec v_e) \qquad \vec v_e = \vec v_i - \vec j / Z e n
$$

The pressure and total temperature are (with charge neutrality)

$$
P \approx n (T_i + Z T_e)
$$

$$
T \approx \frac{T_i + Z T_e}{(1 + Z)/2}
$$

### MHD Momentum Equation

Now we combine the two-fluid equations with these asymptotic approximations to obtain the governing equations for the MHD variables. Multiplying the ion continuity equation by the ion mass gives

$$
\pdv{}{t} (m_i n_i) + \div (m_i n_i \vec v_i) = 0 \\
\rightarrow \pdv{\rho}{t} + \div (\rho \vec v) = 0 \quad \text{(MHD continuity eq.)}
$$

If we multiply the two-fluid continuity equations by the charge and sum them, we get

$$
\pdv{}{t}(q_i n_i - e n_e) + \div (q_i n_i \vec v_i - e n_e \vec v_e) = 0 \\
\rightarrow \div \vec j = 0 \quad \text{(no accumulation of charge)}
$$

If we add the electron and ion momentum equations and apply the small electron mass approximation, and recognizing that \( \vec R_{ei} = - \vec R_{ie} = n e \eta \vec j \) 

$$
\rho_i \left(\pdv{\vec i}{t} + \vec v_i \cdot \grad \vec v_i \right) + \grad (P_i + P_e) + \div (\vec \Pi _i + \vec \Pi_e) \\
\qquad  - (q_i n_i - e n_e) \vec E - (q_i n_i \vec v_i - e n_e \vec v_e) \cross \vec B = 0
$$
$$

If we take the electron momentum equation, apply the small electron mass asymptotic approximation and introduce the current density, then we have

### MHD Ohm's Law

$$
e n_e (\vec E + \vec v_i \cross \vec B - \vec j \cross \vec B / Z e n) = - \grad P_e - \div \vec \Pi_e + \vec R_{ei}

    $$
    \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B = \eta \vec j + \frac{1}{Z e n} \left(\vec j \cross \vec B - \grad p_e - \div \vec \Pi_e \right)
    $$


### MHD Energy Equation

The energy equation is found by adding the ion and electron energies, but first we need to manipulate them into a common form. The ion energy equation is 

$$
\frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \left[ \pdv{}{t} (n_i T_i) + \div (n_i T_i \vec v_i) \right] + n_i T_i \div \vec v_i = RHS_i
$$

where \( RHS_i \equiv - \vec \Pi_i \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_i - \div \vec h_i + Q_{ie} \) 

$$
\frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \left( \pdv{p_i}{t} + \vec v_i \cdot \grad p_i \right) + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} p_i (\div \vec v_i) = RHS_i
$$

Multiply by \( \frac{\gamma - 1}{n_i ^\gamma} \) and define the total derivative with respect to the ion velocity as

$$
\dv{}{t} \equiv \pdv{}{t} + \vec v_i \cdot \grad
$$

$$
\rightarrow \dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p_i}{n_i ^\gamma} \right) - p_i \dv{}{t} \left( \frac{1}{n_i ^\gamma} \right) + \frac{\gamma p_i}{n_i ^\gamma} \div \vec v_i = \frac{\gamma - 1}{n_i ^\gamma} RHS_i
$$

Simplify further by recognizing that carrying out the total derivative gives 

$$
\dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p_i}{n_i ^\gamma} \right) - \frac{\gamma p_i}{n_i ^{\gamma + 1}} \dv{}{t} n_i + \frac{\gamma p_i}{n_i ^\gamma} \div \vec v_i = \frac{\gamma - 1}{n_i ^\gamma} RHS_i
$$

The continuity equation says
$$
\dv{}{t} n_i = - n_i \div \vec v_i
$$
Multiply by \( m_i ^{- \gamma} \) and use \( \rho = n m_i \) and the resulting ion energy equation is

$$
\dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p_i}{\rho ^\gamma} \right) = \frac{\gamma - 1}{\rho ^\gamma} RHS_i
$$

We want to get the electron energy equation in the same form. The steps are very similar:

$$
\dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p_e}{n_e ^\gamma} \right) + \vec v_e \cdot \grad \left( \frac{p_e}{n_e ^\gamma} \right) = \frac{\gamma - 1}{n_e ^\gamma} RHS_e
$$

Since we've defined our center-of-mass reference frame to be that of the ions, we can not use the same total derivative

$$
\pdv{}{t} + \vec v_e \cdot \grad \neq \dv{}{t}
$$

We now apply the charge neutrality approximation

$$
n_e = Z n \qquad \vec v_e = \vec v_i - \frac{1}{Z e n} \vec j
$$

$$
\rightarrow \dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p_e}{Z^\gamma n^\gamma} \right) + \vec v_i \cdot \grad \left( \frac{p_e}{Z^\gamma n^\gamma} \right) = \frac{1}{Z e n} \vec j \cdot \grad \frac{p_e}{Z^\gamma n^\gamma} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{Z^\gamma n^\gamma} RHS_e
$$

Multiply by \( (Z / m_i)^\gamma \) and the result is

$$
\dv{}{t} \frac{p_e}{\rho ^\gamma} = \frac{1}{Z e n} \vec j \cdot \grad \frac{p_e}{\rho^\gamma} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{\rho^\gamma} RHS_e
$$

Finally we can add the ion energy equation to the electron energy equation to get

$$
\dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p}{\rho^\gamma} \right) = \\
\frac{\gamma - 1}{\rho^\gamma} \left[ Q_{ie} + Q_{ei} - \div (\vec h_i + \vec h_e) - \vec \pi_i \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_i - \vec \Pi_e \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_e \right] + \frac{\vec j}{Z e n} \cdot \grad \frac{p_e}{\rho^\gamma}
$$

!!! info "MHD Energy Equation"

    $$
    \dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p}{\rho^\gamma} \right) = \frac{\gamma - 1}{\rho^\gamma} \left[ Q_{ie} + Q_{ei} - \div (\vec h_i + \vec h_e) - \vec \pi_i \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_i - \vec \Pi_e \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_e \right] + \frac{\vec j}{Z e n} \cdot \grad \frac{p_e}{\rho^\gamma}
    $$

Obviously, we've retained a number of terms that are specific to the behavior of the electrons. It is possible to incorporate the electron behavior by using a single-fluid MHD model with two temperatures \( T_i \neq T_e \). One can imagine a hierarchy of models, in which the most simplified is the single-fluid MHD model in which you evolve \( \rho \), \( \vec v \), and \( T \). Moving up a level, you have a MHD model with two temperatures in which you evolve \( \rho \), \( \vec v \), \( T_i \), and \( T_e \). Upwards from there you move back into the realm of multi-fluid models.

Now to relate the fields back to source terms. The low-frequency Maxwell's equations are

$$
\pdv{\vec B}{t} = - \curl \vec E
$$
$$
\vec j = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \curl \vec B
$$
$$
\div \vec B = \div \vec E = 0
$$

Like in the multi-fluid plasma model, we still need to close the system by expressing some of our variables using equations of state (\( \vec h \), \( \vec \Pi \)).

To simplify further, we can make some assumptions about heat flow

$$
\text{isothermal} \qquad \rightarrow p \propto n \qquad T = \text{const.} \qquad \gamma = 1
$$ 
$$
\text{adiabatic} \qquad \rightarrow p \propto n^\gamma
$$
$$
\text{cols plasma / force-free} \qquad \rightarrow p = \text{const.} \qquad \gamma = 0
$$

## Ideal MHD Model

The extended MHD equations are simpler than the two-fluid model, but they can still be quite complicated. We can often still get useful analysis from further reductions. The ideal MHD model is such a reduction that we can get by dropping (with justification) several terms from the extended model. We justify the simplifications by comparing the magnitude of the neglected terms to the terms that are retained.

Recall the characteristic speed is \( v_{T, i} \). If we say that the characteristic length plasma length is \( L \), then we can define characteristic time \( \tau = L / v_{T, i} \). 

The derivation of the two-fluid plasma model assumed a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We need the velocity distribution to thermalize, reach local thermodynamic equilibrium, and become Maxwellian. This means that we need many collisions, in fact so many collisions occurring frequently enough that we can ignore collisional effects. There must then be many collisions during the characteristic time \( \tau \).

For ions to be thermalized,

$$
\frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$ 

And similarly for electrons

$$
\frac{\tau_{e}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$ 

The continuity equation remains unchanged from the extended MHD model

$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div (\rho \vec v) = 0
$$

!!! info "Ideal MHD Continuity Equation"

    $$
    \pdv{\rho}{t} + \div (\rho \vec v) = 0
    $$    

The momentum equation is

$$
\rho \left( \pdv{\vec v}{t} + \vec v \cdot \grad \vec v \right) + \grad p - \vec j \cross \vec B = - \div (\vec \Pi_e + \vec \Pi_e)
$$
Drop the anisotropic pressure

!!! info "Ideal MHD Momentum Equation"

    $$
    \rho \left( \pdv{\vec v}{t} + \vec v \cdot \grad \vec v \right) + \grad p - \vec j \cross \vec B = 0
    $$


The generalized Ohm's law is

$$
\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B = \eta \vec j + \frac{1}{Z e n} \left( \vec j \cross B - \grad p_e - \div \vec \Pi_e \right)
$$

We're going to drop the entire right hand side

!!! info "Ideal MHD Generalized Ohm's Law"

    $$
    \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B = 0
    $$

For the energy equation we have

$$
\dv{}{t} \left( \frac{p}{\rho^\gamma} \right) = \frac{\gamma - 1}{\rho^\gamma} [Q_{ie} + Q_{ei} - \div (\vec h_i + \vec h_e) - \vec \Pi_i \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_i - \vec \Pi_e \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_e] + \frac{\vec j}{Z e n} \cdot \grad \frac{p_e}{\rho^\gamma}
$$

We neglect the entire right-hand side

!!! info "Ideal MHD Energy Equation"

    $$
    \pdv{\rho}{t} + \div (p \vec v) = (1 - \gamma) p \div \vec v 
    $$

### Collision/Pressure terms

If we assume that the ions and electrons are in thermal equilibrium\( T_i = T_e \), we can relate the collision times

$$
\tau_{ee} : \tau_{ii} : \tau_{ei} = 1 : \left( \frac{m_i}{m_e} \right) ^{1/2} : \frac{m_i}{m_e}
$$

The collision times are specifically collisional relaxation times of the Boltzmann equation

$$
\left. \pdv{f}{t} \right|_{coll} = \frac{f - f_{\text{Maxwellian}}}{\tau_{\alpha \beta}}
$$

For electrons, the thermalization condition is much stricter for the ions

$$
\frac{\tau_{ee}}{\tau} = \left( \frac{m_e}{m_i} \right)^{1/2} \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$

Neglect the anisotropic pressure tensor in the momentum and generalized Ohm's law, \( \div \vec \Pi \). \( \vec \Pi \) is primarily the shear stress tensor. The ion thermal speed gives us a characteristic velocity for the plasma, so we use it to characterize the shear stress

$$
\vec \Pi_{i, max} \sim 2 \mu \left( \pdv{u}{x} - \frac{1}{3} \div \vec v \right) \sim \mu \frac{v_{T, i}}{L}
$$

Standard treatments of the viscosity (Braginskii, etc.) show that viscosity scales with the number density, temperature, and collision time

$$
\mu \sim n T_i \tau_{ii} \sim p_i \tau_{ii}
$$

$$
\Pi_{i, max} \sim p_i \frac{\tau_{ii} v_{T, i}}{L}
$$

The specific term we want to get rid of is \( \div \vec \Pi \), so let's compare it to a term we want to keep \( \grad P \) 

$$
\frac{\div \vec \Pi}{\grad p} \sim \frac{p_i \tau_{ii} v_{T, i} / L^2}{p_i / L} \sim \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau}
$$

So, to neglect the anisotropic pressure term in the momentum equation, once again we require

$$
\frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$

In other words, as long as the plasma is collision-dominated, we can drop the ion anisotropic pressure term. What about associated the electron term? If you can assume \( T_i \approx T_e \). Then \( p_i \approx p_e \) for a neutral plasma, and

$$
\frac{\div \vec \Pi_e}{\grad p} \sim \frac{p_i \tau_{ee} v_{T, i} / L^2}{p_i / L} \sim \frac{\tau_{ee}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$

### Magnetic terms

In the generalized Ohm's law, the diamagnetic drift term is

$$
\frac{\grad p_e}{Z e n} \sim \frac{n T_e / L}{Z en} \sim \frac{T_i / L}{Ze} \sim \frac{m_i v_{T, i}^2}{L Z e}
$$

Compare \( \grad p_e / Z e n \) to a term that we're going to keep, which is the dynamo term \( \vec v \cross \vec B \)

$$
\frac{ \grad p_e / Z en}{|\vec v \cross \vec B|} \sim \frac{m_i v_{T, i}^2}{LZe}{v_{T, i} B} \sim \frac{m_i}{ZeB}\frac{v_{T, i}}{L} = \frac{v_{T, i}}{\omega_{c, i}} \frac{1}{L} \sim \frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \ll 1
$$

So to neglect the diamagnetic drift term, we need the plasma to be well-magnetized. This means the Larmor radius must be much less than the plasma characteristic length \( r_{L, i} \ll L \)

Now what can we do with the Hall term \( \frac{\vec j \cross \vec B}{Zen} \). For a static plasma (or one with subsonic flows):

$$
\rho (\pdv{\vec v}{t} + \vec v \cdot \grad \vec v) - \grad p - \vec j \cross \vec B = 0
$$

so by "subsonic" we mean that the static pressure is much larger than the dynamic pressure and we can discard the \( \vec v \) terms.

$$
\vec j \cross \vec B \approx \grad p
$$

Comparing the Hall term to the dynamo term \( \vec v \cross \vec B \) also gives the same requirement

$$
\frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \ll 1
$$

How well do some real plasmas hold up to the requirements of ideal MHD? Consider field nulls in a Z-pinch or an FRC, and weakly magnetized plasmas (such as those in a Hall thruster). Clearly, the magnetization requirement does not hold up at all points in space, and ideal MHD does not necessarily apply across the whole domain.

### Resistivity

We neglect resistivity and the resistive electric field \( \eta \vec j \) in the generalized Ohm's law

$$
\eta \vec j \sim \eta \frac{\grad p}{B} \sim \frac{ \eta n T}{LB}
$$

$$
\eta = \frac{m_e \nu_{ei}}{n e^2} = \frac{m_e}{n e^2 \tau_{ei}} = \frac{m_e ^2/ m_i}{n e^2 \tau_{ee}}
$$

$$
\rightarrow \eta \vec j \sim \frac{m_e ^2}{e^2 L B} \frac{v_{T, i} ^2}{\tau_{ee}}
$$

How does it compare to \( \vec v \cross \vec B \)

$$
\frac{\eta \vec j}{|\vec v \cross \vec B|} \sim \left(\frac{m_e}{m_i} \right)^2 \frac{m_i}{e ^2 B^2} \frac{v_{T, i} ^2}{L^2} \frac{L}{v_{T, i} \tau_{ee}} \sim \left( \frac{m_e}{m_i}\right)^2 \frac{v_{T, i} ^2}{\omega_{c, i} ^2} \frac{1}{L^2} \sim \left( \frac{m_e}{m_i} \right) ^{3/2} \left( \frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \right) ^{2} \frac{\tau}{\tau_{ii}} \ll 1
$$

This now places a lower limit on \( \tau_{ii} \); to neglect resistivity \( \tau_{ii} \) cannot be too low

$$
\left( \frac{m_e}{m_i} \right) ^{3/2} \left( \frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \right) ^{2} \ll  \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$

### Heating sources

Neglect the collisional heating sources \( Q_{ei} \), \( Q_{ie} \) in the energy equation. We do that by assuming that they are equal and opposite, which only happens when the temperatures are equal. In other words, we are again assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium _between_ electrons and ions.

$$
1 \gg \frac{\tau_{ei}}{\tau} = \left( \frac{m_i}{m_e} \right)^{1/2} \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \rightarrow \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll \left( \frac{m_e}{m_i} \right) ^{1/2}
$$

This is a much more restrictive condition than ion collisionality. Alternatively, we could track two temperature independently.

We also neglect the heat flux terms \( \div (\vec h_i + \vec h_e) \) in the energy equation. Consider parallel (to the magnetic field) heat conduction which dominates since \( \kappa_\perp \ll \kappa_\parallel \), so

$$
\div \vec h \approx \grad_\parallel \cdot (\kappa_\parallel \grad_\parallel T)
$$

$$
\grad_\parallel \cdot \left[ ( \kappa_{\parallel, i} + \kappa_{\parallel, e}) \grad_\parallel T \right]
$$

$$
\kappa_{\parallel, e} \sim \frac{n T_e}{m_e} \tau_{ee} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \kappa_{\parallel, i} \sim \frac{n T_i}{m_i} \tau_{ii}
$$

$$
\frac{\kappa_{\parallel, e}}{\kappa_{\parallel, i}} \sim \frac{\tau_{ee}}{\tau_{ii}} \frac{m_i}{m_e} \sim \left( \frac{m_i}{m_e} \right) ^{1/2}
$$

Compare the thermal conductivity to the rate of pressure change \( \pdv{p}{t} \) 

$$
\frac{\grad_\parallel \cdot (\kappa_{\parallel, e} \grad_\parallel T)}{\pdv{p}{t}} \sim \frac{n T^2 \tau_{ee}/m_e L^2}{nT/\tau} \sim \left( \frac{m_i}{m_e} \right)^{1/2} \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1
$$

We're back to the same requirement that we have ion-electron local thermodynamic equilibrium.

### Anisotropic pressure terms in energy equation

Neglect the anisotropic pressure terms in the energy equation. That is, \( \vec \Pi_i \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_i \) and \( \vec \Pi_e \cdot \cdot \grad \vec v_e \).  Skipping ahead, the result is

$$
\frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \ll 1 
$$
$$
\left( \frac{m_e}{m_i} \right)^{1/2} \frac{\tau_{ii}}{\tau} \frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \ll 1
$$

### Electron convection term

Lastly, we neglect the electron convection term in the energy equation \( \frac{\vec j}{Zen} \cdot \grad \frac{P_e}{\rho^\gamma} \). The result is

$$
\frac{r_{L, i}}{L} \ll 1
$$
