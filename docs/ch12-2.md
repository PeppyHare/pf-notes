# Plasma Models

## Ideal MHD

Let's start from a full-particle description with the goal of reaching a continuum description (kinetic model). Then, we'll look at the forces on the separate species and form a multi-fluid model, finally simplifying to a single-fluid MHD model.

The most important question to ask ourselves is "when is this model going to be useful?" The MHD model is the mathematical model for magnetized plasmas that are treated as a fluid. This means that we can define a fluid element (some lil' box of plasma) and define the physical properties (mass, density, magnetization, etc.) of the element. We need to make some assumptions about scale in order to do this. In terms of spatial scales, we abstract properties below a discrete scale $a_0$ into the properties of a fluid element

$$
\frac{a_0}{L} \rightarrow 0 \qquad a_0 = \text{discrete scale} \qquad L = \text{spatial scale of interest}
$$

Length scales smaller than the discrete scale will not be properly captured by the model, so scales like the particle radius will be meaningless in our fluid model.

## Plasma Definition

A plasma is a quasi-neutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibit _collective behavior_. The particles (electrons, ions, neutrals) interact through EM fields and collisions.

Mathematically you would think that plasmas could be treated as individual particles. Doing so gives an N-body problem with classical interactions through the Lorentz force (Coulomb interaction removed by assumption of quasi-neutrality) and binary collisions. Each particle \( i \)  has a well-defined mass \( m_i \)  and charge \( q_i \)  which do not change in time. The governing equations are

$$
\dv{\vec v_i}{t} = \frac{q_i}{m_i} (\vec E + \vec v_i \cross \vec B) + \sum_{j \neq i} \left[ \left. \dv{\vec v_{ij}}{t} \right|_{coll} (\vec r_i - \vec r_j) \right]
$$
$$
\dv{\vec r_i}{t} = \vec v_i
$$

The fields E and B are described by the Maxwell equations

$$
\pdv{B}{t} = - \curl E
$$
$$
\frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{E}{t} = \curl B - \mu_0 \sum_i q_i v_i \delta (r - r_i)
$$
$$
\div B = 0
$$
$$
\epsilon_0 \div E = \sum_i q_i \delta (r - r_i)
$$

## Klimontovich Equation

Re-writing the force relations as a statement of conservation in phase space, we get Klimontovich equation for species \( \alpha \) 

$$
\dv{N_\alpha}{t} = 0 = \pdv{N_\alpha}{t} + \pdv{}{q} \cdot (\dot{q} N_\alpha) + \pdv{}{p} \cdot (\dot{p}N_\alpha)
$$

The particle phase space is defined by 
$$
N_\alpha(p, q) = \sum_i \delta(p - p_i) \delta(q - q_i)
$$
where \( p \) and \( q \) are generalized momentum and position coordinates. The resulting \( N(p) \) looks very spiky, with nonzero values only at the exact values inhabited by particles. Unfortunately, that means that only the tools of discrete mathematics are applicable to the distribution, and we're forbidden from our favorite tool (calculus). To make the analysis possible, we can smooth over the discreteness by performing an ensemble average of the Klimontovich equation. This gives us a statistical description using smooth distribution functions:

$$
f(x, v, t) \qquad \frac{(\text{no. of particles})}{(\text{unit distance})^3(\text{unit velocity})^3}
$$

That is, \( f(x, v, t) \) is the number of particles at position \( x \) with velocity \( v \) at time \( t \). We also work with normalized distributions which give the probability of finding a particle.

By our definition, we can integrate to get the total number of particles at time \( t \).

$$
\int \int \dd x \dd v f(x, v, t) = N(t)
$$

The ensemble averaging process works well if the the number of particles is very large

$$
N \gg 1
$$

<p align="center"> <img alt="Figure 12.1" src="../img/12.1.png" /> </p>

See a kinetic theory text (e.g. Krall and Trivelpiece) for a full description of the ensemble averaging process.

Now we can write our Klimontovich equation in terms of continuous quantities

$$
\pdv{f}{t} + \left[ \pdv{}{q} \cdot (\dot{q} f) + \pdv{}{p} \cdot (\dot{p}f) \right] = \text{(cross terms)}
$$

The collision terms now have an infinite number of cross terms. We call this the BBGKY (Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon) hierarchy.

Expressing as the Boltzmann equation (generally called the Boltzmann-Maxwell equation, since the solution requires solving for the electromagnetic fields of the Maxwell equations)

$$
\pdv{f_\alpha}{t} + \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} + \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} = \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll}
$$

We leave the collision term in. A lot of the work of kinetic theory is coming up with an applicable form of the collision operator which is appropriate but still simple enough to solve. We often write the collision operator as the product of binary collisions

$$
 \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = \sum_\beta C_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Notice that the terms \( \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \) and \( \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \) are advection equations, advecting in \( \vec x \) and \( \vec v \) respectively. If we ignore the collision term (set the RHS to zero) we have the Vlasov equation.

Note that the fields E and B at any location are generated from the charges and currents of the entire plasma volume, including externally applied fields. As a result, there's an inherent integrating process taking into account the sources across the whole volume that leads to long-range smoothly varying forces. This is in contrast to the collisional effects, which by their nature lead to very short range abrupt forces. It makes sense to make a distinction between the long-range electromagnetic forces and the short range collisional forces.

Because the Boltzmann-Maxwell model is inherently 6-dimensional, it is a very challenging model to implement. The B-M model provides a complete description, but it is often too detailed to solve.

If we solve the Vlasov equation for two parallel opposite beams, for example, we see that the 

As it turns out, the integral, centroid, and variance are all that are required to fully describe a Maxwellian distribution

$$
f_{M, \alpha} (\vec v) = n_0 \left( \frac{ m_\alpha }{2 \pi T_\alpha} \right)^{3/2} \text{exp}\left[ - \frac{ \frac{1}{2} m_\alpha (v - v_\alpha)^2}{T_\alpha} \right]
$$

In other words, we can write the Maxwellian distribution as \( f_M(n_0, \vec v_\alpha, T_\alpha ; \vec v) \). We care about Maxwellian distributions so much in plasma physics because it is the solution to the Boltzmann equation for \( \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = 0 \) (Vlasov equation). That's not saying that there are no collisions, it is saying that there are so many collisions that the effect is isotropic and the overall force is zero.

Another feature of the Maxwellian distribution is \( \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} = 0 \). This is a famous result called the Boltzmann H-theorem, and says that any initial distribution will relax (and very quickly) to a Maxwellian distribution.

By replacing our velocity distribution with the associated Maxwell distribution, we arrive at a Plasma Fluid Model 

## Plasma Fluid Model

We take velocity moments of each of the pieces of the kinetic model:
  - distribution function, \( f_\alpha \) \( \rightarrow \) fluid variables
  - Boltzmann Equation \( \rightarrow \) governing equations describing the evolution of the fluid variables.

Starting with the zeroth moment (integral) of the distribution function:

$$
\int f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = n_\alpha(\vec x, t)
$$

1st Moment (momentum):

$$
m_\alpha \int \vec v \cdot  f_\alpha(\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = \vec p_\alpha (\vec x, t) = m_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha
$$

which is to say that the velocity is the 1st moment divided by the zeroth moment

$$
v_\alpha = \frac{\int \vec v f_\alpha}{\int f_\alpha}
$$

2nd Moment:

$$
\int \vec v \vec v f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v = \vec E_\alpha(\vec x, t) (\text{energy tensor})
$$

We can simplify the 2nd moment by taking a reduced 2nd moment. This means that we're going to insert a dot product

$$
\int \vec v \cdot \vec v f_\alpha (\vec x, \vec v, t) \dd \vec v
$$

Before moving forward, we want to define a "random" velocity. Note that

$$
\int \vec v f_\alpha - \vec v_\alpha \int f_\alpha = 0 \rightarrow \int (\vec v - \vec v_\alpha) f_\alpha \dd \vec v = 0
$$

We can define a random velocity \( \vec w = \vec v - \vec v_\alpha \). It is random in the sense that it is a fluctuation about the mean velocity, and when we integrate it we get zero. We can use this to define the energy tensor using the mean velocity to get a meaningful result. The pressure tensor is the second moment, using the random velocity

$$
\vec P_\alpha = m_\alpha \int \vec w \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v = P_\alpha \overline{I} + \overline{\Pi}_\alpha
$$

where we've decomposed the pressure into an isotropic value \( P_\alpha \) and what's called the Braginskii stress tensor \( \overline{Pi}_\alpha \). The average isotropic pressure is given by the reduced 2nd moment:

$$
P_\alpha = n_\alpha T_\alpha = \frac{1}{3} \int m_\alpha \vec w \cdot \vec w f_\alpha
$$

where the factor of \( 1/3 \) comes from the number of degrees of freedom in our system. It is related to the thermodynamic factor \( \gamma \) where \( \gamma = \frac{DOF + 2}{DOF} \). Now we can define the temperature \( T_\alpha \) as

$$
T_\alpha (\vec x, t) = \frac{1}{DOF} \frac{\int m_\alpha \vec w \cdot \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v}{\int f_\alpha \dd \vec v}
$$

Now that we've got \( n_\alpha \), \( v_\alpha \), and \( T_\alpha \) we have what we need to define a Maxwellian distribution. Higher moments would be required to describe non-Maxwellian distribution functions. For example, the 3rd moment is called the skewness of the distribution. The 4th moment is the kurtosis. So on and so forth. These give a measure of degree of departure from a Maxwellian distribution, in which case it is often more useful to talk about the excess kurtosis, where the excess kurtosis of a Maxwellian is defined to be zero. You can continue to calculate the moment expansion, and in general it requires an infinite number of moments to describe an arbitrary distribution function. Because of the Boltzmann H-theorem and the tendency of plasmas to quickly relax to Maxwellian, we can usually get away with using just the first three moments.

Now, what are the governing equations? We get these by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation. Let's proceed carefully in sections, so we'll integrate each piece of the BE in terms.

### 0th Moment of Boltzmann Equation (Conservation)

$$
\int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v + \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \left. \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} \dd \vec v
$$

First, we take \( \int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v \). Because t and v are both independent variables, with an argument of sufficient smoothness we can reverse the order of integration and differentiation

$$
\int \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t}\int f_\alpha \dd v = \pdv{n_\alpha}{t}
$$

For \(  \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v \) we can perform an integration by parts

$$ \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{x} \dd v = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \vec v \dd \vec v \\
 = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v  \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) = \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha)
$$

Once again, we've switched the order of integration of \( x \)  and \( v \), which we can only do because we have specified that \( f \) is a distribution function, and as such meets the criterion of sufficient smoothness.

For the last part, we can write it as a surface integral

$$
\int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \oint f_\alpha \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} ( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \dd S_v - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \dd \vec v
$$

For \( f_\alpha \) to be well-defined, we require \( \lim_{v \rightarrow \infty} v^3 f_\alpha = 0 \) so the surface term vanishes and we're left with

$$
\int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \dd \vec v 
$$

Distributing the divergence through, 

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \vec E = 0
$$
because \( \vec E \) is independent of \( \vec v \).

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot ( \vec v \cross \vec B) = 0
$$
because \( \vec v \cross \vec B \) is always orthogonal to \( \vec v \).

We've been working through this in normal vector notation for familiarity, but there is another notation known as Einstein Tensor Notation using the lovely Levi-Civita symbol \( \epsilon_{ijk} \).

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} = 1 \qquad \text{even permutations of i j k} \\
 = -1 \qquad \text{odd permutations of i j k} \\
= 0 \qquad \text{any repeated indexes}
$$


We can write out vector products as products of indices and operators, and any repeated indices are implicitly summed:

$$
\vec v \cross \vec B = \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k = \sum_{jk} \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k
$$

where \( \epsilon_{ijk} \) is defined to be 1 for even permutations of ijk, -1 for negative permutations if ijk, and 0 for any repeated indices.

We can now write the derivative with respect to \( \vec v \) as

$$
\pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \vec v \cross \vec B = \partial _{v_i} \epsilon_{ijk} v_j B_k \\
= \epsilon_{ijk} (\partial_{v_i} v_j) B_k
$$

We see that we're taking the derivative of the j-th component of velocity with respect to the i-th component of velocity, and _that's_ how we can most easily point out that the quantity is zero without relying on properties of 3-vector products.

We'll also want to use the divergence in Einstein tensor notation

$$
\div \vec A = \partial_i A_j \delta_{ij} = \partial_i A_i
$$

Finally, we come back to the collision term in the zeroth moment of the B-M equation

$$
\sum_\beta \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = 0
$$

We can say the collision term is zero by making a physical argument, rather than a mathematical one. We assert that collisions cannot create or destroy particles. This assumption is now baked into our equations going forward, but is not always true! Ionization, recombination, fusion reactions all create/destroy species.

Finally, we've got

$$
\pdv{n_\alpha}{t} + \div ( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) = 0 \qquad \text{continuity equation}
$$

### 1st Moment of Boltzmann Equation

$$
\int \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \vec v  \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v + \int \vec v \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \left. \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll}
$$

Term 1:

$$
\int \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \dd \vec v = \pdv{}{t} \int \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v - \int \pdv{\vec v}{t} f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{t} \left( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \right)
$$

Before we get to the second term, let's have an aside about dyad math. An outer product \( \vec A \vec B \) gives a second-rank tensor. In Cartesian coordinates, it looks like

$$
\vec A \vec B = \begin{bmatrix}
A_x B_x & A_x B_y & A_x B_z \\
A_y B_x & A_y B_y & A_y B_z \\
A_z B_x & A_z B_y & A_z B_z \\
 \end{bmatrix}
$$

A useful property to do with dot products:

$$
\vec A \vec B \cdot \vec C = \vec A ( \vec B \cdot \vec C ) = (\vec A \vec B) \cdot \vec C
$$

$$
( \vec V \cdot \grad) \vec B = \vec V \cdot ( \grad \vec B)
$$

Back to term 2:

$$
\int \vec v \vec v \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec x} \dd \vec v = \int \vec v \cdot \pdv{}{\vec x} ( \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int \vec v f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \vec v \dd \vec v \\
 = \int \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot ( \vec v \vec v f_\alpha) \dd \vec v - \int \vec v f_\alpha \cdot \pdv{\vec v}{\vec x} \dd \vec v \\
 = \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int \vec v \vec v f_\alpha \dd \vec v
$$

Re-expanding in terms of random velocity \( \vec v = \vec v_\alpha + \vec w \)

$$
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) (\vec v_\alpha + \vec w) f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \int (\vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha + \vec v_\alpha \vec w + \vec w \vec v_\alpha  + \vec w \vec w)  f_\alpha \dd \vec v \\
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left[ \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \int f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \vec v_\alpha \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v + \left( \int \vec w f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right) \vec v_\alpha + \int \vec w \vec w f_\alpha f_\alpha \dd \vec v \right]
$$

The middle two terms are zero by the very definition of \( \vec v_\alpha \). The random velocity \( \vec w \) is defined such that the integral of the random velocity over all phase space is zero.

$$
= \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \left( \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha n_\alpha \right) + \pdv{}{\vec x} \cdot \frac{ \vec P_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \\
= \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \div \vec P_\alpha
$$

Substituting in the pressure tensor,

$$
= \div ( n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha ) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \left( \grad P_\alpha  + \div \vec \Pi _\alpha \right)
$$

Moving on to term 3:

$$
\int \vec v \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{f_\alpha}{\vec v} \dd \vec v = \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[( \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) f_\alpha \right] \vec v \dd \vec v - \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} f_\alpha \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[ \vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B \right] \vec v \dd \vec v \\
= \int \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} \pdv{}{\vec v} \cdot \left[ f_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v \cross \vec B) \vec v \right] \dd \vec v - \int \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} f ( \vec E + \vec v\alpha \cross \vec B) \cdot \pdv{\vec v}{\vec v} \dd \vec v \\
= \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} \oint f\alpha ( \vec E + \vec v\alpha \cross \vec B) \vec v \cdot \dd \vec S_v - \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} \left[ \vec E \int f \dd \vec v\alpha - \vec B \cross \int \vec v f\alpha \dd \vec v \right] \\
= - \frac{q\alpha}{m\alpha} n\alpha (\vec E + v\alpha \cross \vec B)
$$

Finally, the 4th term gives

$$
 \int \left. \vec v \pdv{f_\alpha}{t} \right|_{coll} = \sum_\beta \int \vec v C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \\
= \int \vec v C_{\alpha \alpha} \dd \vec v + \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \int \vec v C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$

Collisions of like particles \( \alpha \) do not result in a net change of momentum of species \( \alpha \), so all we have left is the change in momentum due to collisions of unlike particles

$$
= \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \left[ \vec v_{\alpha} \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v + \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v \right]
$$

For the same reason as before, we assert that collisions between particles \( \alpha \)  and \( \beta \)  do not lead to the creation or destruction of any species, so the 0th moment \( \int C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = 0\). This leads to the conclusion that only random motion contributes to momentum transfer, not \( \vec v_\alpha \). Viscosity and friction are good examples of similar physical processes where bulk velocity does not transfer momentum, but random motion does.

The momentum transfer from \( \alpha \)  to \( \beta \) must equal transfer from \( \beta \) to \( \alpha \). Momentum is globally conserved.

$$
\int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v = - \int \vec w C_{\beta \alpha} \dd \vec v
$$

Now we can finally write out the full momentum equation

$$
\pdv{}{t} (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha ) + \div (n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \frac{1}{m_\alpha} \div \vec P_\alpha - \frac{q_\alpha}{m_\alpha} n_\alpha ( \vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$

The collision term is often represented as the momentum transfer vector \( \vec R_{\alpha \beta} \) to \( \alpha \) from \( \beta \).

$$
\vec R_{\alpha \beta} \equiv m_\alpha \int \vec w C_{\alpha \beta} \dd \vec v
$$
$$
\pdv{}{t} (m_\alpha n_\alpha v_\alpha) + \div (m_\alpha n_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \vec v_\alpha) + \grad \vec P_{\alpha} + \div \vec \Pi_{\alpha} - q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta} R_{\alpha \beta}
$$

Once again, we've written the above in a conservation law form. The terms that aren't strictly conservation terms are the source term \( q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v _\alpha \cross \vec B) \) and sink term \( \sum_{\beta} R_{\alpha \beta} \).

Introducing the mass density

$$
\rho_\alpha = m_\alpha n_\alpha \qquad \text{mass density}
$$

$$
\pdv{}{t} (\rho_\alpha \vec v _\alpha) + \div (\rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha v_\alpha + \ldots \\
= \rho_\alpha \pdv{\vec v_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \left( \pdv{\rho_\alpha}{t} + \div \rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \right) + \rho_\alpha \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha + \ldots
$$
The term in parentheses is just the continuity equation, which is zero, and what's left is a more usual form of the momentum equation

$$
\rho_\alpha \left(\pdv{\vec v_\alpha}{t} + \vec v_\alpha \cdot \grad \vec v_\alpha \right) + \grad \vec P_\alpha + \div \vec \Pi_\alpha - q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec E + \vec v_\alpha \cross \vec B) = \sum_{\beta \neq \alpha} \vec R_{\alpha \beta}
$$
